                            we provide you with the most relevant adverts where possible by anonymously tracking your
                            interests and presenting similar things that may be of interest.</p>
                        <p>Several partners advertise on our behalf and affiliate tracking cookies simply allow us to see if
                            our customers have come to the site through one of our partner sites so that we can credit them
                            appropriately and where applicable allow our affiliate partners to provide any bonus that they
                            may provide you for making a purchase.</p>

                            {List the social networks whose features you have integrated with your site?:12}, will set
                            cookies through our site which may be used to enhance your profile on their site or contribute

                        <p>More Information</p>
                        <p>Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something
                            that you aren&rsquo;t sure whether you need or not it&rsquo;s usually safer to leave cookies
                            enabled in case it does interact with one of the features you use on our site.</p>
