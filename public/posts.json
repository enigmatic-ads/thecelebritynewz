    "content": "The pleasing back-to-basics feel in&nbsp;<em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps&nbsp;</em>suggests&nbsp;Marvel&nbsp;has learned valuable lessons from its recent box office underperformers. There&rsquo;s a fresh willingness to prioritize character over the usual barrage of interchangeable CG action sequences that often overwhelm them, instead giving us relatable folks to invest in. Equally important is the decision to make this a legitimate stand-alone requiring no homework. The expectation that audiences would have intimate knowledge of a sprawling multiverse covered in a glut of features and TV series no doubt contributed to&nbsp;the perception of genre fatigue.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nA quote on the end credits from Jack Kirby, who created the comic book series with Stan Lee in 1961, reads: &ldquo;If you look at my characters, you will find me. No matter what kind of character you create or assume, a little of yourself must remain there.&rdquo; Director&nbsp;Matt Shakman and screenwriters Josh Friedman, Eric Pearson, Jeff Kaplan and Ian Springer appear to have taken that to heart. The eponymous quartet may have superpowers, but they are also a family, struggling like most of us to handle the most daunting responsibilities life throws our way.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nDespite the popularity of the long-running comics,&nbsp;<em>The Fantastic Four</em> has an undistinguished history as a screen vehicle. The dismal 2015 reboot, which attempted to give the property the dreaded gritty overhaul, had the distinction of being worse than the mediocre 2005 feature and its sequel two years later, in which the leads had all the relaxed camaraderie of people who had just met on the set that day.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nTwo very funny 2013 episodes of&nbsp;<em>Arrested Development</em>&nbsp;revolved around a parody musical inspired by the never-released 1994 Roger Corman movie (its stars make cameos here). But for many of us who are not avid comic book readers, any surviving fondness for&nbsp;<em>The Fantastic Four</em> is thanks to distant memories of the 1967 Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon series that ran on ABC for just 20 episodes but resurfaced for decades in reruns.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThat would appear to be the case also for the filmmakers, who give&nbsp;<em>First Steps</em>&nbsp;a delightful 1960s retro-futuristic look and feel, echoed in Michael Giacchino&rsquo;s rousing orchestral score, as well as Kasra Farahani&rsquo;s production design and Alexandra Byrne&rsquo;s costumes. The interpretation of New York City around the time the comics were born yields great visual charm &mdash; from Times Square to the Lower East Side &mdash; with amusing period-specific product placement for brands like 7Up and Canada Dry.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nEven the origin story elements are handled in vintage style in an ABC special celebrating four years of the Fantastic Four, hosted by the ingratiatingly square Ted Gilbert (Mark Gatiss).<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nWe learn that scientific genius Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal) led a space expedition with his wife, Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), and her brother, Johnny (Joseph Quinn), piloted by their good friend Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach). When their rocket ship encountered a cosmic storm, it altered their DNA, returning them to Earth with superpowers, and in Ben&rsquo;s case, a vastly different physique.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nReed has elastic limbs and can stretch like a rubber band; Sue is able to become invisible and can generate powerful force fields and blasts; Johnny is a cocky overgrown kid also known as the Human Torch, who can engulf himself in flames and fly; and Ben is a massive, boulder-like hulk with superhuman strength to match.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nTheir achievements in disaster intervention and peacekeeping &mdash; shown in grainy news footage that includes them thwarting the attempt of the Mole Man (Paul Walter Hauser) to destroy the Pan Am building &mdash; have made the Fantastic Four media darlings and the planet&rsquo;s most adored protectors.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nStranding an actor as magnetic as Moss-Bachrach behind motion-capture technology that makes him look like the rock monster from&nbsp;<em>Galaxy Quest&nbsp;</em>might seem a limiting choice. But it&rsquo;s remarkable how much warmth and sensitivity he injects into the character &mdash; also known as The Thing in the comics. Despite his stony features and musclebound body, he&rsquo;s the most vulnerable of the group, his sad eyes seeming to convey his belief that he&rsquo;s unlikely ever to experience love. That comes through especially in Ben&rsquo;s moments with Rachel, a sweet elementary school teacher from his old neighborhood, played by an underutilized but lovely&nbsp;Natasha Lyonne.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe other members of the group also are characterized in distinctly human terms, irrespective of their extraordinary abilities. Reed is an inventor of immense intelligence who thinks in mathematical equations yet often has difficulty expressing himself emotionally. Sue is tough and decisive, no less a figurehead to this makeshift family than Reed. Johnny is an impulsive thrill-seeker, craving the others&rsquo; approval and perhaps a little bothered by the feeling that they see him as immature. (Quinn looks at times uncannily like a young Robert Downey Jr. with a blond dye job.)<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nWhen not in their iconic blue-and-white spacesuits, Byrne outfits them to fit their respective personalities. Reed wears professorial cardigans and ties; Sue favors sleek turtlenecks and fitted skirts (and what looks like a Pucci bathrobe in the boudoir); Ben sports the favorite-uncle look of sweater vests and plaid shirts; and the fit on Johnny of a denim jacket and beige jeans should do wonders for Levi&rsquo;s sales.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<div id=\"browsi_adWrapper_ai_2_ati_1_rc_0\">\r\n<div id=\"browsi_adContainer_ai_2_ati_1_rc_0\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_4__container__\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_11__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\nThe actors are so terrific and their chemistry so palpable that the hangout scenes in their fabulous Baxter Building penthouse &mdash; with a domestic droid that&rsquo;s like Rosie the Robot from&nbsp;<em>The Jetsons</em>&nbsp;meets Number 5 from John Badham&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Short Circuit</em>&nbsp;&mdash; are some of the movie&rsquo;s most appealing interludes. The closeness of their dynamic is fortified by the surprise news early on that after years of trying unsuccessfully to have a child, Sue is pregnant.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe crisis that forces them to leave home and venture back into space is heralded by the arrival of the Silver Surfer (Julia Garner), alerting the citizens of Earth that their planet is about to be destroyed by a cosmic entity named Galactus. &ldquo;Your world will be consumed by the Devourer,&rdquo; she announces, without a trace of emotion.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nMaking a change from the more common depiction of the Silver Surfer as male, Garner cuts a commandingly lean-and-mean figure in her CG metallic suit. Her countenance is icy and distant and her fight skills as formidable as her speed, but the persistent attentions of Johnny Storm eventually expose a softer side of her and a sorrowful history in the climactic stretch. Until then, however, she does the dirty work of Galactus (Ralph Ineson).<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nWhen Reed traces the Silver Surfer&rsquo;s presence to a string of planets that have been obliterated, the Fantastic Four take off in their spaceship. Despite Sue&rsquo;s approaching due date, they decide it&rsquo;s better to seek out their adversary than wait out the Earth&rsquo;s destruction. But their attempt to negotiate with Galactus &mdash; an ancient gargantuan iron man with a corroded tin-can casing covered in nuts and bolts &mdash; falls apart when he offers to spare Earth in exchange for the child Sue is carrying.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe group&rsquo;s hair-raising return to New York with the hard-to-shake Silver Surfer in pursuit, and the birth of Sue and Reed&rsquo;s son, Franklin, during a light-speed jump in zero gravity, raise the stakes considerably. The certainty of Galactus that only their child can assume his throne and free him from his insatiable hunger to consume worlds also raises doubts about Franklin developing superpowers, whereas all of Reed&rsquo;s tests showed the baby to be an ordinary mortal.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nShakman skillfully balances the humor of the family dynamic with the gravity of the situation they are facing, steadily amping up the suspense as the story builds to Galactus&rsquo; inevitable descent to Earth, dropping out of the sky into the East River and stomping through the Lower East Side with thundering noise that rips right through you. (The movie packs a visceral charge seen in Imax.)<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nRather than allowing the action to define the story, the filmmakers let the poignant character-based scenes do the heavy lifting. That should not imply any lack of excitement, but the clashes are fueled by the deep love of the four principal characters for each other and their corresponding urge to keep the people of their world safe.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-10-1\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\nFamily as a force of hope and strength is the key theme here, communicated stirringly by Kirby when Sue addresses the crowd after their refusal to sacrifice the child to save the planet turns public opinion against them. And a scene between Sue and Reed near the end is heart-wrenching, played with agonized depth of feeling by Pascal. But this is not a movie where it&rsquo;s easy to single out an MVP among the principals. All four leads bring something special to their respective roles and to the superbly gauged balance of personalities that makes each of them essential to the group.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nMidcentury modern enthusiasts will go nuts for the stunning design elements. The Fantastic Four&rsquo;s stylish digs in particular display a wealth of detail and d&eacute;cor choices that are somehow both kitschy and cool, from breakfast bar swivel stools and lamps to a gorgeous wall-recessed liquor bar on the living room mezzanine. Shakman successfully employed 1950s and &lsquo;60s aesthetics in the Disney+ series&nbsp;<em>WandaVision</em>, but the period vibe here more directly recalls&nbsp;<em>X-Men: First Class</em>. It&rsquo;s fun but never campy.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe CG work is slick, as expected, but it&rsquo;s the seamless integration of digital elements with practical set builds that makes&nbsp;<em>First Steps</em>&nbsp;seem so fully inhabited &mdash; and not just a bunch of actors in front of greenscreens. Despite its vivid and electric space sequences, the visually striking movie often feels like a throwback analog good time, which certainly worked for me.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nStick around through the end credits for the obligatory teaser of what&rsquo;s in store and a breezy homage to an earlier iteration. A tag reveals: &ldquo;The Fantastic Four will return in&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>.&rdquo; But here&rsquo;s hoping this disarming family unit will get to run their own show again.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"browsi_adWrapper_ai_1_ati_1_rc_0\">\r\n<div id=\"browsi_adContainer_ai_1_ati_1_rc_0\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_2__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Their legacy rivals that of Mel Brooks in the &rsquo;60s and &rsquo;70s, most notably via&nbsp;<em>Airplane!</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>Naked Gun</em>&nbsp;movies, though I also have a soft spot for their swerve into more conventional farce with the acerbic dark comedy&nbsp;<em>Ruthless People</em>. Even the misstep of&nbsp;<em>Top Secret!</em> yielded its share of laughs, despite attempting to hit an unwieldy jumble of parody targets.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nHaving honed their skills in a college sketch-comedy troupe, the trio&rsquo;s strategy was to throw as many jokes per minute at the screen as possible, the sillier the better, ensuring that enough of them stuck to cushion the ones that missed the mark.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nTheir 1982 ABC series spoofing crime procedurals,&nbsp;<em>Police Squad!</em>, lasted just six episodes. But ZAZ resurrected the idea for the big screen in 1988 with&nbsp;<em>The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&nbsp;</em>(these guys seldom met an exclamation point they didn&rsquo;t love), which became a successful trilogy centering on&nbsp;Leslie Nielsen&rsquo;s bumbling but oblivious Detective Sergeant Frank Drebin.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nCut to 31 years later &hellip;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nNobody could accuse director Akiva Schaffer (who, like ZAZ, hails from a comedy trio, The Lonely Island) and his co-writers or producer Seth MacFarlane of lacking affection for the material. That&rsquo;s evident in the sweet homages to Nielsen and George Kennedy as Capt. Ed Hocken &mdash; O.J. Simpson not so much.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe filmmakers follow the formula to a T in this legacy sequel or reboot or whatever you want to call it, enlisting the sons of Drebin (Liam Neeson) and Hocken (Paul Walter Hauser) as the new Police Squad team to provide plot continuity. Even if the movie kind of stalls midway as Schaffer struggles to balance the gags with the action of an overly elaborate crime plot, there are enough laugh-out-loud moments to keep nostalgic fans of the earlier films happy and maybe make some new converts.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nJust as Nielsen was established primarily as a dramatic actor before becoming a ZAZ linchpin in&nbsp;<em>Airplane!</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Naked Gun</em>, Neeson arrives trailing the gravitas of his late-career reinvention as a steely dispenser of vengeance and retribution, in&nbsp;<em>Taken</em>&nbsp;et al. The actor&rsquo;s dead serious delivery provides a subtle meta underlay as Frank Jr. takes down bad guys and tackles a master criminal, starting with a bank robbery prologue whose funniest jokes are given away in the trailer.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe heist ties into the suspicious death of a brilliant tech engineer, whose electric vehicle went off the road. The victim&rsquo;s sister, Beth Davenport (MVP&nbsp;Pamela Anderson), seeks Frank&rsquo;s help in investigating what she&rsquo;s convinced was murder. He tells her to leave the detective work to the professionals, but they both turn up at a club run by her brother&rsquo;s boss, Edentech founder Richard Kane (Danny Huston).<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nA mogul cut from the Elon Musk mold, Kane has a nefarious plan involving an amusingly named PLOT Device (Primordial Law of Toughness) with mind-altering properties, which is part of what he calls &ldquo;Project Inferno.&rdquo; But before that gets activated, he cozies up to Frank with the gift of Police Squad&rsquo;s first electric cop car.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nWeary of dealing with angry calls from the mayor about Frank&rsquo;s blithe trail of city property destruction, police chief Davis (CCH Pounder) warns him to play nice with major donor Kane, since Police Squad&rsquo;s funding is at risk.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThat thread doesn&rsquo;t really go anywhere in the script by Dan Gregor, Doug Maud and Schaffer. Nor does Kane&rsquo;s talk of a &ldquo;Doomsday Giggle Bunker,&rdquo; where entertainment will be provided by &ldquo;Weird Al&rdquo; Yankovic &mdash; one of a handful of celebrity cameos. The same goes for Hauser&rsquo;s thankless role as Ed Hocken Jr., who plays straight man to Frank&rsquo;s self-serious dimwit, when the writers remember to include him.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nEven in a spoof of a police procedural, the crime under investigation needs a minimum of internal logic, but mastermind Kane&rsquo;s big scheme to destroy and remake Los Angeles &mdash; and possibly the world &mdash; to his own specifications pushes the movie almost into the absurdist espionage territory of the&nbsp;<em>Austin Powers</em>&nbsp;series. Senior or junior, Frank Drebin is an L.A. city cop, not Ethan Hunt.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nLuckily, Neeson and Anderson have enough spark to carry the film, not to mention great chemistry. I could have done without the padding of a winter cabin romantic interlude with a killer snowman &mdash; there&rsquo;s a difference between dumb and annoyingly stupid &mdash; but their scenes together are the high points throughout.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nHearing Neeson express Frank&rsquo;s enduring anger about the Janet Jackson Super Bowl incident, reflect on the cultural importance of the Black Eyed Peas, berate Beth for messing up his&nbsp;<em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>&nbsp;recordings or break down the characters on&nbsp;<em>Sex and the City</em>&nbsp;after someone says &ldquo;Miranda rights&rdquo; is a droll pleasure. His tough-guy physical comedy also scores, as he swats off armed criminals or bites off the barrel of a gun pointed at him without breaking a sweat.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThere&rsquo;s a moment early on in which he kneels beneath his father&rsquo;s photograph on the Police Squad wall of honor and says, &ldquo;I want to be just like you, but at the same time, completely different.&rdquo; Which is pretty much the manifesto of anyone reviving a popular franchise after multiple decades of dormancy.&nbsp;<em>The Naked Gun</em>&nbsp;is at least a step up from the lifeless&nbsp;<em>Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F</em>, to name one recent example.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nNeeson clearly is having a blast sending up his hyperviolent screen persona of recent years, and his enjoyment is infectious up to a point. But even when the narrative momentum sputters as the movie loads up on jokes at the expense of structure or character, Neeson&rsquo;s scenes with Anderson are bliss.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nContinuing her renaissance after&nbsp;<em>The Last Showgirl</em>, Anderson displays impeccable comic timing, never leaning too hard into a line when her breathy throwaway delivery can land a bigger laugh. At one point, Kane asks Beth, &ldquo;May I speak freely?&rdquo; She replies, &ldquo;I prefer English.&rdquo; In another moment, Frank, curious about where she went to college, asks, &ldquo;UCLA?&rdquo; With only the tiniest frown of confusion, she tells him, &ldquo;I see it every day. I live here.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nDialogue like that may come from the hoariest school of comedy writing, but the charm of Anderson&rsquo;s buoyant screen presence keeps it fresh and funny. Beth is a character who defends her crime-solving instincts by saying, &ldquo;I write true crime stories, based on fictional crimes that I make up.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s crucial to Anderson&rsquo;s performance that Beth sails over every idiocy the script throws at her as if she&rsquo;s making perfect sense.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nI kept wishing the movie were as consistently entertaining and as sure of its footing as Anderson and Neeson are in their roles. But even if the laughs are hit-or-miss and the plotting shaky, there&rsquo;s enough inspired nonsense here to keep comedy-starved theatrical audiences engaged. To the filmmakers&rsquo; credit, that includes the kind of retrograde, politically incorrect humor &mdash; the cops&rsquo; anatomical appreciations of Beth are a hoot &mdash; that makes the movie feel almost like the old&nbsp;<em>Naked Gun</em>.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

    "content": "The post-pandemic theatrical landscape has mostly been an anxiety disorder punctuated by the occasional high. But one genre has consistently drawn audiences back to the multiplex in the past few years: horror.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nNo longer just pegged to Halloween, horror movies now dot the release calendar year-round.&nbsp;<em>M3GAN 2.0</em>&nbsp;may have fizzled last month but&nbsp;<em>28 Years Later</em>&nbsp;found new blood in a franchise only a fraction younger than its title. The legacy sequel&nbsp;<em>I Know What You Did Last Summer</em>, which opened last weekend, tests the limits of &lsquo;90s nostalgia, while Dave Franco and Alison Brie&rsquo;s Sundance body-horror hit,&nbsp;<em>Together</em>, arrives July 30. Hopes also are high for&nbsp;<em>Weapons</em>, with Josh Brolin and Julia Garner, opening early next month.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nSince the turn of the 20th century, horror &mdash; first in literary form and later in movies &mdash; has reflected social anxieties about a rapidly changing world. In a 21st century plagued by such concerns as global warming, the rise of AI technology, democracy in peril and the demonization of &ldquo;the other,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s unsurprising that horror in the past 25 years has become unusually fertile terrain, ushering in what might arguably be called a new golden age of screen terror.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThat made it a challenging task to whittle down a roundup of just 25 favorites, covering studio releases and indies, American and international. For every film included on the entirely subjective ranked list below, a handful of others regrettably got bumped (see Honorable Mentions for several of them).<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nI make no apologies for personal preferences that lean more toward atmospheric or allegorical horror than sadistic schlock, so you won&rsquo;t find&nbsp;<em>The Human Centipede</em>&nbsp;slithering here.

And as much as I enjoyed&nbsp;<em>X</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pearl</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>MaXXXine</em>, Ti West&rsquo;s playful trilogy showcasing the vixenish charms of Mia Goth, I opted to skip slasher flicks in favor of the occult.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nFinally, please don&rsquo;t bitch and moan about David Lynch&rsquo;s incomparable&nbsp;<em>Mulholland Drive</em>&nbsp;not being here.

The Italian director also bathes the movie in unexpected sweetness, poetry, lush sensuality and emotional depth. Evincing simmering chemistry, Taylor Russell and Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet play the protein-diet drifters on a cross-country road trip, feasting whenever they can, &ldquo;bones and all,&rdquo; on human flesh. Separating and reuniting, they find a home in each other and attempt to live a normal life, until the past &mdash; in the maximum-eccentricity form of Mark Rylance &mdash; catches up with them in a shattering final act. Guadagnino cites Terrence Malick&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Badlands</em>&nbsp;as an influence, but this oddly tender trail of death evokes a whole panoply of American outsider tales.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\r\n<div id=\"adm-in-list-1\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbody1-uid0\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbody1_0__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__slide-wrapper\">\r\n<article class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__header\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-details\">\r\n<h2 class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title\">24.

A group of Adelaide teens who never met a frightening moment unsuitable for social media sharing somehow get a hold of what&rsquo;s allegedly a severed forearm encased in ceramic. By clutching the hand and saying the three words of the title, they invite the dead to occupy their bodies. But there&rsquo;s a strict 90-second limit before the presence puts down roots. In a knockout big-screen debut, Sophie Wilde plays Mia, whose mother&rsquo;s apparent suicide makes her especially receptive to spiritual exploration. But a crisis explodes when Mia&rsquo;s surrogate little brother stays too long at the party. The talented Philippous handily sidestepped the sophomore jinx with this year&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Bring Her Back</em>.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\r\n<div id=\"adm-in-list-x\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyx-uid1\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_0__container__\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_4__container__\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_7__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__slide-wrapper\">\r\n<article class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__header\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-details\">\r\n<h2 class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title\">23.

With solid support from Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe, the suspenseful film tracks a family&rsquo;s survival ordeal in a post-apocalyptic America overrun with spindly, blind extraterrestrials whose acute sense of hearing allows them to pinpoint their doomed targets in seconds. Early on, Krasinski folds in shattering tragedy that many films might have saved for the climax. Instead, here it raises a pulse rate that seldom slows down. The sequel,&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place: Part II</em>, and prequel,&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>, are not half bad either.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\r\n<div id=\"adm-in-list-x-1\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyx-uid2\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_1__container__\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_8__container__\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_9__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__slide-wrapper\">\r\n<article class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__header\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-details\">\r\n<h2 class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title\">22.

Set in 1988 as post-revolutionary conflict rages on, the movie plays like one of Asghar Farhadi&rsquo;s intense domestic dramas deftly crossed with paranormal horror in the vein of&nbsp;<em>Poltergeist</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>The Babadook</em>. The cultural specificity of its political turmoil and the feminist view of a society that oppresses women turn up the alarm of a former leftist radical (played with fierce grit by Narges Rashidi) trying to save herself and her young daughter from a seemingly inescapable war and an infestation of djinn &mdash; Middle Eastern spirits carried by the wind &mdash; bent on dividing or destroying them. The most haunting image of this white-knuckle watch is a faceless figure in a whirling chador that threatens to engulf the mother.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\r\n<div id=\"adm-in-list-x-2\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyx-uid3\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_2__container__\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_10__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__slide-wrapper\">\r\n<article class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__header\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-details\">\r\n<h2 class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title\">21.

One of the best is&nbsp;Remi Weekes&rsquo; debut, a highly original marriage of haunted house terror with harrowing social realism. The film depicts the refugee experience as its own kind of horror &mdash; fleeing the violent massacres of a war-torn country; making a perilous crossing in an overcrowded boat; surviving, albeit with sacrifices and guilt; and then facing the endless bureaucratic red tape that asylum seekers are required to navigate, along with the myriad anxieties of cultural displacement. Wunmi Mosaku (a standout in&nbsp;<em>Sinners</em>) and Sope Dirisu bring agonizing depth of feeling to their roles as South Sudanese refugees. Their adjustment to life in England goes from difficult to hellish when they discover that their dilapidated government-assigned housing is inhabited by an &ldquo;apeth,&rdquo; a night witch that has followed them from East Africa to claim retribution for their sins.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\r\n<div id=\"adm-in-list-x-3\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyx-uid4\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_3__container__\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_11__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__slide-wrapper\">\r\n<article class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__header\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-details\">\r\n<h2 class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title\">20.

Alison Lohman plays Christine, a loan officer angling for a promotion, who needs to convince her boss she&rsquo;s no soft touch. But when she refuses to extend Sylvia Ganush&rsquo;s mortgage, even after the elderly European Roma woman begs not to have her house repossessed, Christine finds herself saddled with a curse &mdash; a &ldquo;lamia,&rdquo; to be precise &mdash; promising three days of demonic torment before she&rsquo;s dragged to you know where. The epic tussle in the parking lot between Christine and Sylvia (played with ferocious cruelty by a stage veteran with the fantastic name of Lorna Raver) is one for the ages.

The only escape is by sleeping with someone else and letting them fend off the lethal entity, which can take on any form, including that of friends and family. Maika Monroe stars as the young Detroit suburbanite with a target on her back, who enlists her friends to help thwart the possibly supernatural assailant. Mitchell cited George A. Romero, John Carpenter and still photographer Gregory Crewdson as influences on the taut, almost unbearably tense film&rsquo;s seductive visual compositions, full of virtuosic pans and voyeuristic tracking sequences.

Wells&rsquo; novel about an unseen aggressor, previously the source for horror titan James Whale&rsquo;s 1933 film. Along with casting Elisabeth Moss, Whannell&rsquo;s best idea was firmly anchoring his modern version in the #MeToo age, focusing not on the title character, a mad tech scientist who fakes his own death after cracking the invisibility code, but on the girlfriend traumatized by his abusive behavior. Not since Peggy Olson has Moss been so enthrallingly subsumed by a role as she is playing Cecilia Kass, increasingly freaked by her ex&rsquo;s stalking and gaslighting until she turns vengeful.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\r\n<div id=\"adm-in-list-x-7\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyx-uid8\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_15__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__slide-wrapper\">\r\n<article class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__header\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-details\">\r\n<h2 class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title\">16.

It stars a magnetic Michael B. Jordan as twin brothers known as Smoke and Stack, Chicago gangland veterans returning to the Mississippi Delta to open a juke joint. But beyond that compelling narrative spine, the movie is a soaring ode to the spiritual and supernatural power of the blues, an allegory about the elusiveness of freedom and an orgy of vampire violence. The time and care spent on character and milieu make the explosive carnage pop in a pulse-racing thriller with a lot on its mind.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\r\n<div id=\"adm-in-list-x-8\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyx-uid9\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_16__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__slide-wrapper\">\r\n<article class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__header\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-details\">\r\n<h2 class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title\">15.

Welsh actress Morfydd Clark plays the tightly wound Maud as a zealous self-appointed savior, obsessed with rescuing the darkened soul of her private patient Amanda, who is slowly succumbing to cancer. Played by a never-better Jennifer Ehle with a cymbal clash of withering hauteur and fearful neediness, the once-celebrated dancer seems an unlikely candidate for absolution &mdash; she&rsquo;s an unapologetic hedonist, a non-believer and a fiend for sins of the flesh, indulging during regular visits from her girlfriend. The enthralling interplay between the principal characters steers them toward mutual destruction as Glass orchestrates a crescendo in which demonic visions and splinters of the supernatural collide with religious ecstasy.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\r\n<div id=\"adm-in-list-x-9\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyx-uid10\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_17__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__slide-wrapper\">\r\n<article class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__header\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-details\">\r\n<h2 class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title\">14.

Switching the protagonist from a governess to the World War II-era mother of two photosensitive children, the movie gives Nicole Kidman one of her finest roles, her porcelain beauty and emotional fragility lending a tragic grandeur to the character&rsquo;s isolation, breakdown and collapse into perceived madness. Conjuring a dreamy atmosphere out of the hushed, candlelit manor, the Chilean-Spanish director honors the classic ghost story while deepening its trauma with suffocating repression.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\r\n<div id=\"adm-in-list-x-10\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyx-uid11\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_18__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__slide-wrapper\">\r\n<article class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__header\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-details\">\r\n<h2 class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title\">13.

They build a farm in the nearby woods, where an evil force attaches itself to them &mdash; grim news for the outcasts, starting with their infant son. The focus gradually settles on spirited teenager Thomasin, played by Anya Taylor-Joy in a revelatory breakthrough, her unholy alliance with a talking goat named Black Phillip bringing this slow-burn folk horror to its shivery conclusion. Eggers&rsquo; attention to authenticity and detail in the language, lore and design of the film has become a hallmark of his work across four idiosyncratic period pieces to date.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\r\n<div id=\"adm-in-list-x-13\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyx-uid14\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/list/inbodyX_21__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__slide-wrapper\">\r\n<article class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__header\">\r\n<div class=\"c-gallery-vertical-details\">\r\n<h2 class=\"c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title\">10.

Having contributed an indelible portrait of a sensitive but spiky mother in one of the &rsquo;90s&rsquo; most iconic horror hits,&nbsp;<em>The Sixth Sense</em>, Toni Collette reaches almost operatic heights of hysteria as another spooked mom, Annie, notably in a spectacularly angry meltdown with her traumatized teenage son, played by Alex Wolff. The entire ensemble, which also includes Gabriel Byrne, Milly Shapiro and Ann Dowd, is exceptional. Making Annie a mixed-media miniature artist specializing in architectural models allows Aster to frame the entire story as if in a dollhouse, depicting the home not as a refuge but a point of entry for a malevolent coven.

The intelligence, conviction and mounting heebie-jeebies with which the married couple approach their work anchors the movie as the Warrens in 1971 battle to save a Rhode Island family whose house stands on land cursed by the Satanist witch who died there. Old-fashioned in the best possible sense of favoring practical over digital effects, it locks the viewer in a stranglehold of fear.

A bullied 12-year-old boy finds companionship when a pale, mysterious girl who appears to be around his age moves in next door. While never edging away from pre-sexual innocence, their friendship evolves into love, even as gruesomely murdered bodies mount up and she is revealed to be an ancient vampire with an insatiable bloodlust.

Daniel Kaluuya stars as a photographer meeting the parents of his white girlfriend (Alison Williams), thrust into a nightmarish reality in which the aggressively welcoming, seemingly ultra-liberal WASPs &mdash; played to insidious perfection by Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener &mdash; have other plans for him.

It&rsquo;s no surprise that he would make the most original and enigmatic horror movie of the new century &mdash; also among the most polarizing &mdash; with this experiential adaptation of the Michel Faber novel. Scarlett Johansson is in quiet command as an extraterrestrial female in Scotland, preying on lone men whom she lures into an inky abyss, until the discovery of human empathy scrambles her instincts. The scene in which the alien seduces and then spares the life of a facially disfigured man played by Adam Pearson is as affecting as it is disturbing. Few films deliver more hypnotically on the promise of their title.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Such is certainly the case with the sequel to&nbsp;<em>The Bad Guys</em>, the 2022 hit adapted from Aaron Blabey&rsquo;s best-selling graphic book series. Beginning with an elaborate caper and car chase through the streets of Cairo that would make Tom Cruise jealous,&nbsp;<em>The Bad Guys&nbsp;2</em> seeks to outshine the original at every turn. It smacks of overkill, but fortunately the film, smartly directed by Pierre Perifel, also features the same wit and charm that proved so appealing to youngsters and adults alike in the first movie.</div>\r\n<div class=\"lrv-u-line-height-large a-children-icon-spacing-none lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-size-18\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"lrv-u-line-height-large a-children-icon-spacing-none lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-size-18\">At the film&rsquo;s beginning, the&nbsp;<em>Reservoir Dogs</em>-style-named anthropomorphized animal criminal group &mdash; consisting of leader Mr. Wolf (Sam Rockwell), safecracker Mr. Snake (Marc Maron), comically inappropriate master-of-disguise Mr. Shark (Craig Robinson), quick-tempered Mr. Piranha (Anthony Ramos) and hacker Ms. Tarantula (Awkwafina) &mdash; have been released from prison and are attempting to go straight. But it proves difficult considering their criminal past, as demonstrated by a very funny scene featuring Mr. Wolf applying for a job at a bank he&rsquo;s robbed multiple times. Needless to say, he doesn&rsquo;t get it.</div>\r\n<div class=\"lrv-u-line-height-large a-children-icon-spacing-none lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-size-18\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"lrv-u-line-height-large a-children-icon-spacing-none lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-size-18\">So it&rsquo;s not surprising that they find themselves pulled back into committing another heist. This time, they&rsquo;re partnered with the distaff Bad Girls: snow leopard Kitty Kat (Danielle Brooks), their ruthless leader; wild boar Pigtail (Maria Bakalova), their science wizard; and raven Doom (Natasha Lyonne, right on the heels of her stellar voice work in&nbsp;<em>Smurfs</em>), with whom Mr. Snake has been romantically involved. (We get to see them in a make-out session, involving Mr. Snake hilariously unhinging his jaw).</div>\r\n<div class=\"lrv-u-line-height-large a-children-icon-spacing-none lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-size-18\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"lrv-u-line-height-large a-children-icon-spacing-none lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-size-18\">\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-2\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article2-uid1\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-article2_0__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\nThe caper, involving the theft of a rocket ship from a tech billionaire (Colin Jost) bearing no small resemblance to a certain chainsaw-wielding real-life figure, is silly enough to justify the film&rsquo;s use of the term MacGuffinite as one of its principal elements. It definitely smacks of James Bond, from its&nbsp;<em>Moonraker</em>-like foray into outer space to its diabolical plot to steal the world&rsquo;s entire supply of gold.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAlong the way, there are colorful episodes galore, including one involving a Mexican wrestling match, and the return of numerous supporting characters from the first film. One highlight involves Wolf&rsquo;s love interest, the literally and figuratively foxy Governor Foxington (Zazie Beetz), visiting the villainous Professor Marmalade (Richard Ayoade) in prison looking for advice. Now seriously bulked-up, the massive guinea pig greets her like a rodent Hannibal Lecter.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe film features far too many fart jokes courtesy of the ever-flatulent Mr. Piranha, although that can be readily forgiven in an animated film since the small fry always find those hilarious. But the screenplay by Yoni Brenner and Etan Cohen is generally much smarter than that, featuring a plethora of sly one-liners revolving more around characterizations than pop-culture references. It helps mightily that they&rsquo;re delivered by such a stellar ensemble of performers, who actually seem to have been cast for their vocal abilities rather than their names (although there&rsquo;s no shortage of star power).<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-5\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid2\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_0__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAll of them are absolutely terrific, but the clear stand-out, now and before, is Rockwell, who invests his portrayal with the same flair and precision evident in his live-action performances.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nDisplaying the same visual dynamism as its precursor,&nbsp;<em>The Bad Guys 2</em> garners even more laughs with its abrupt edits that land like animated mic drops. Daniel Pemberton&rsquo;s lively musical score adds to the antic fun.<br>\r\n</div>",

    "content": "Mark Ruffalo&nbsp;is returning to reprise the role of Bruce Banner, aka the Hulk, in the feature, which comes 14 years after the actor joined the MCU in&nbsp;<em>The Avengers</em>. The move had been rumored for a while but only firmed up as the script came together and as production gears up for beginning this month in England.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAt the same time, Michael Mando, known for his work on&nbsp;<em>Better Call Saul</em>, is returning to reprise the role of the Scorpion, the villain character whom he first played in&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man: Homecoming,</em>&nbsp;the 2017 feature that kicked off the Holland-centric Spider-Man movies.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nHolland&rsquo;s Spider-Man films have always paired him with a more seasoned actor, such as Robert Downey Jr. (<em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>), Samuel L.

    "summary": "Plus, a jaw-dropping (literally) screening at Comic-con and a RealReal robbery in Santa Monica (yet again).",
    "content": "James Bond certainly knows his way around a casino, but even he might raise an eyebrow at who oddsmakers are betting will play him next. According to the latest probabilities from gambling site VegasInsider,&nbsp;Aaron Taylor-Johnson&nbsp;is now the clear favorite to slip into 007&rsquo;s tux, with odds hovering around 2.4-to-1.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nBut before anyone bets the house on the 35-year-old<em>&nbsp;Kick-Ass</em>&nbsp;actor, industry sources note the game hasn&rsquo;t really begun &mdash; the cards haven&rsquo;t even been dealt. In fact, Taylor-Johnson&rsquo;s frontrunner status may owe less to spy-craft than to spin-craft. His odds have been clearly boosted by a string of U.K. press leaks &mdash; most notably in&nbsp;<em>The Sun</em>, which has been touting him as the next Bond ever since Daniel Craig holstered his Walther PPK. In late 2022, the tabloid quoted &ldquo;insiders&rdquo; claiming Taylor-Johnson had &ldquo;impressed&rdquo; producer Barbara Broccoli during a &ldquo;top-secret screen test&rdquo; at Pinewood Studios.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nA few months later, another so-called insider claimed: &ldquo;Bond is Aaron&rsquo;s job, should he wish to accept it.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nBut Rambling&rsquo;s own insiders point out a few issues with that narrative. Historically, Bond screen tests are tightly controlled 007 rituals &mdash; usually involving a scene out of&nbsp;<em>From Russia With Love</em>&nbsp;&mdash; and they don&rsquo;t happen until a director is on board. And in 2022, there was no director. (Denis Villeneuve wasn&rsquo;t hired until June.) Besides, even if Taylor-Johnson had knocked Broccoli&rsquo;s socks off at that supposed 2022 test, that shouldn&rsquo;t be influencing his odds in 2025 &mdash; Broccoli and her half brother Michael G. Wilson sold the franchise to Amazon earlier this year. These days, it&rsquo;s Amy Pascal&rsquo;s socks that need knocking off. She&rsquo;s running&nbsp;Bond&nbsp;now.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-2\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article2-uid1\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-article2_0__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nVegas handicappers also might have been swayed by a round of recent online tea-leaf reading after Taylor-Johnson&rsquo;s auspiciously timed deal to become a global ambassador for Omega &mdash; the official Bond timepiece &mdash; back in May. That was seen by some as a clear sign the role was his. It wasn&rsquo;t. Otherwise, past Omega ambassadors like Nicole Kidman, George Clooney and Zo&euml; Kravitz would&rsquo;ve been zipping around in Aston Martins years ago.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nWhat VegasInsider isn&rsquo;t factoring in is that all of the above &mdash; the leaks, the whispers, the watch deal &mdash; might actually be hurting Taylor-Johnson&rsquo;s chances. As Rambling&rsquo;s insider puts it: &ldquo;The more you push for the role, the more it can backfire. Wanting it too much can be the best way not to get it.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<h3 class=\"heading larva //   lrv-a-font-accent-l   \">RealReal Robbery Was Really Real. But SMPD Says Nothing to See Here</h3>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nTimes are so tough these days, even the criminals are thrifting.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nOn July 18, in the latest affront to Santa Monica, more than a dozen masked marauders stormed the RealReal secondhand luxury boutique on 26th Street &mdash; near the Brentwood border &mdash; where celebrities from Kim Kardashian and Julianne Moore to Parker Posey and Kate Moss are said to unload their no-longer-needed Herm&egrave;s, Cartier and Rolex accessories. It was a brazen, broad-daylight smash-and-grab: Surveillance cameras captured the crew looting high-end resale items and loading them into getaway cars with the license plates removed.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThis marks the third flash-mob-style hit on the same store in three years &mdash; but unlike the previous break-ins, no arrests have yet been made. In fact, investigators are now looking into whether the crew might be linked to a similar gang that hit an Anaheim jeweler just one day earlier. In that case, thieves wielding hammers and pickaxes were chased off when the store owner fired a warning shot.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nA spokesperson for the Santa Monica Police Department tells Rambling that detectives are &ldquo;aware of the recent incident in Anaheim and are coordinating with law enforcement partners to assess any potential connections&rdquo; &mdash; adding, without prompting, that any perceived increase in criminal activity is purely imaginary. &ldquo;We have not seen a recent spike in organized retail thefts in Santa Monica,&rdquo; the spokesperson insists. &mdash; MERLE GINSBERG<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<h3 class=\"heading larva //   lrv-a-font-accent-l   \">A Jaw-Dropping Screening at Comic-Con &hellip; Literally</h3>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nFor once, the most talked-about title at San Diego&rsquo;s&nbsp;Comic-Con&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t a Marvel or DC tentpole &mdash; it was a dystopian horror story so graphically violent, organizers literally covered it up.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe 6,500 attendees who turned out to see footage of&nbsp;<em>The Long Walk</em>, Lionsgate&rsquo;s adaptation of Stephen King&rsquo;s 1979 novel about 100 teenage boys forced to compete in a deadly endurance challenge &mdash; walk 3 miles an hour or be executed &mdash; were shown 20 minutes of the movie. But what they didn&rsquo;t get to see &mdash; because it was blacked out on the screen &mdash; was a particularly brutal moment in which a young man&rsquo;s jaw is blown off by a bullet.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;Fans will get a lot out of it when they see it in theaters,&rdquo; was about all Garrett Wareing, who plays one of the contestants, would say about the cover-up while speaking to Rambling after the screening.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nFrom the sound of it, shooting the film&mdash; directed by&nbsp;<em>Hunger Games</em> alum Francis Lawrence &mdash; was almost as brutal as what ended up in the can. The young cast walked miles daily, developing real blisters and bruises. &ldquo;At some points, we&rsquo;re not acting,&rdquo; Wareing confesses. &ldquo;Those limps you see? Those are real limps.&rdquo; He recalls one co-star pausing because he thought he had something in his shoe. &ldquo;He pulls off his Converse, and his socks were just filled with blood,&rdquo; Wareing says. &ldquo;I would sit down on the hot road [between takes] and be like, &lsquo;God, this is what peace feels like.&rsquo; I never thought asphalt would be so comfortable.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nStill, proving that misery does indeed love company, all the actors claimed to have had a blast on the Winnipeg shoot. Offers co-star Tut Nyuot, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t imagine filming this movie with people that I didn&rsquo;t really get along with.&rdquo;<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-13-1\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid3\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Soon after he walked off stage, he got a call from Los Angeles asking if he could be at a meeting in London in 20 minutes.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;And I was like, I&rsquo;m already there.

    "summary": "The doctor, who would have gone on trial in August, became the fourth of five people charged in connection with the actor's death to plead guilty.",
    "content": "A doctor who was a primary target in the sweeping investigation of actor&nbsp;Matthew Perry&lsquo;s overdose death pleaded guilty Wednesday to supplying the&nbsp;<em>Friends</em>&nbsp;star with ketamine despite knowing he was a struggling addict.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nDr. Salvador Plasencia&nbsp;became the fourth of the five people charged in connection with Perry&rsquo;s death to plead guilty. He and a woman prosecutors say was a major ketamine dealer faced the most serious charges after Perry was found dead in the hot tub of his Los Angeles home on Oct. 28, 2023.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nPlasencia stood next to his lawyer and said &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; four times for four different counts before Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett in federal court in Los Angeles.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nPlasencia, 43, was to have gone on trial in August until the doctor agreed last month to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe charges can carry up to 40 years in prison. He is likely to be sentenced to much less, but there is no guarantee in his agreement.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nHe spoke only to answer the judge&rsquo;s questions. When asked if his lawyers had considered all the possibilities of pleas and sentencing in the case, Plasencia replied, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve considered everything.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;Dr. Plasencia is profoundly remorseful for the treatment decisions he made while providing ketamine to Matthew Perry,&rdquo; the doctor&rsquo;s attorney, Debra White, said in an emailed statement after the hearing. &ldquo;He is fully accepting responsibility by pleading guilty to drug distribution. Dr. Plasencia intends to voluntarily surrender his medical license, acknowledging his failure to protect Mr. Perry, a patient who was especially vulnerable due to addiction.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nIn exchange for the guilty pleas, prosecutors have agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nProsecutors outlined the charges in court before the plea, and said that he did not sell Perry the dose that killed the actor.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThey described, and Plasencia admitted, that Perry froze up and his blood pressure spiked when the doctor gave him one injection, but Plasencia still left more ketamine for Perry&rsquo;s assistant to inject.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nIn court, Perry was referred to only as &ldquo;victim MP.&rdquo; Plasencia acknowledged that he knew the actor was in addict when he charged him thousands of dollars and gave him ketamine, a drug primarily used as a surgical anesthetic.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nPlasencia has been free on bond since shortly after his arrest in August, and will be allowed to remain free until his Dec. 3 sentencing.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nDefense lawyer Karen Goldstein assured the judge that he is not a flight risk, saying he was born and raised in the area and is one of the primary caretakers for his son, who is about 2 years old.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nPlasencia has already turned over his license to prescribe controlled substances. He has been allowed to practice medicine in the past year, but he must inform patients of the charges before treating them. Goldstein told the judge he&rsquo;ll now surrender his medical license too.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nPlasencia left the courthouse with his lawyers without speaking to reporters gathered outside.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;While Dr. Plasencia was not treating Mr. Perry at the time of his death,&rdquo; his lawyer&rsquo;s statement said, &ldquo;he hopes his case serves as a warning to other medical professionals and leads to stricter oversight and clear protocols for the rapidly growing at-home ketamine industry in order to prevent future tragedies like this.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe only remaining defendant who has not reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office is Jasveen Sangha, who prosecutors allege is a drug dealer known as the &ldquo;Ketamine Queen&rdquo; and sold Perry the lethal dose. Her trial is scheduled to begin next month. She has pleaded not guilty.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAccording to prosecutors and co-defendants who reached their own deals, Plasencia illegally supplied Perry with a large amount of ketamine starting about a month before his death on Oct. 28, 2023.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAccording to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a &ldquo;moron&rdquo; who could be exploited for money.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nPerry&rsquo;s personal assistant, his friend, and another doctor all agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their cooperation as the government sought to make their case against larger targets, Plasencia and Sangha. None have been sentenced yet.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nPerry was found dead by the assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine was the primary cause of death.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe actor had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. Perry began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nPlasencia admitted in his plea agreement that another patient connected him with Perry, and that starting about a month before Perry&rsquo;s death, he illegally supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine totaling 100 mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-22-1\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid3\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_3__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nHe admitted to enlisting another doctor, Mark Chavez, to supply the drug for him, according to the court filings.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;I wonder how much this moron will pay,&rdquo; Plasencia texted Chavez, according to Chavez&rsquo;s plea agreement.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nPerry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on&nbsp;<em>Friends</em>, when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC&rsquo;s megahit.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-15\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid2\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

There was also, among others, a 1976 version of&nbsp;<em>Freaky Friday</em> whose lackluster script and broad direction were somewhat redeemed by the irresistible pairing of Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nBut Mark Waters&rsquo; 2003 remake raised the bar, with zesty dialogue (courtesy of writers Heather Hach and Leslie Dixon), energetic physical comedy and well-matched leads with strong chemistry. It remains easily the best screen adaptation of Mary Rodgers&rsquo; 1972 kid-lit classic.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nSadly, there&rsquo;s nothing even remotely as funny in the new follow-up,&nbsp;<em>Freakier Friday</em>, as Lohan&rsquo;s high school grunge rocker Anna Coleman waking up in the body of Curtis as her control-freak psychotherapist mother Tess and screaming in horror at the mirror: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like the crypt-keeper!&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nArriving 22 years and countless other body-swap comedies after its predecessor, Nisha Ganatra&rsquo;s &ldquo;freakquel&rdquo; (blame&nbsp;Disney&nbsp;for that one, not me) swaps the earlier film&rsquo;s buoyancy and charm for manufactured chaos that&rsquo;s far more strained and aggressive. In fact, your mileage with this one might depend on your tolerance for Curtis dialing up the wacky meter to maximum volume in a performance so manic and screechy she makes Donna, her recurring character on&nbsp;<em>The Bear</em>, seem demure.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe intergenerational sparring and mother-daughter friction that fueled the laughs in&nbsp;<em>Freaky Friday</em>&nbsp;are diluted in a script by Jordan Weiss (Hulu&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Dollface</em>) that sticks to much of the earlier template but doubles the body-swap shenanigans. That spreads the awkward hilarity of the scenario too thin, to the point where you start to forget who&rsquo;s who. Or stop caring.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nJust as the 2003 film exploded from the conflict of rebellious teenage Anna&rsquo;s resentment that Tess was planning to replace her late husband by marrying Ryan (Mark Harmon), the sequel spins around the threat of another major disruption to the family dynamic.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThis time it&rsquo;s single mother Anna, whose wedding to widowed Brit restaurateur Eric (Manny Jacinto) is looming after a whirlwind six-month courtship. Anna&rsquo;s surly 15-year-old daughter Harper (Julia Butters) is vehemently opposed to the possibility of being uprooted and moved to London. Eric&rsquo;s daughter Lily (Sophia Hammons), also 15, is hostile to the idea of staying on in Los Angeles rather than getting back to England to enroll in fashion school. Naturally, the two teens hate each other, leading to a school bake-sale food fight that&rsquo;s pure Disney Channel.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nWhile Rosalind Chao and Lucille Soong are among the returning&nbsp;<em>Freaky Friday</em>&nbsp;cast, their characters have little to do, but at least the filmmakers wisely dispense with the &ldquo;Asian voodoo&rdquo; fortune-cookie factor.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nInstead, first Anna and Tess and then Harper and Lily land at the table of bargain-basement psychic Madame Jen (Vanessa Bayer, working hard for little dividend), who surprises even herself by intuiting that the older Colemans&rsquo; lifelines have intersected before. Without knowing where the mantra even comes from, Madame Jen tells the teens: &ldquo;Change the hearts you know are wrong, to reach the place where you belong.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAnyone who saw the first go-round will know what a rumbling earthquake felt only by the four ladies portends. At midnight, Anna and Tess find themselves in the bodies of Harper and Lily, respectively, and vice versa. Panic and confusion ensue, along with a major wrench in the marriage plans, as they get to experience each other&rsquo;s lives through different eyes, eventually discovering empathy and common ground that previously were elusive.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nOne issue here is that grown-up Anna and middle-aged Tess are a lot less fun than their younger counterparts, no matter who&rsquo;s inhabiting their bodies. There&rsquo;s some pleasure in seeing Lohan return to one of her most beloved roles (alongside&nbsp;<em>Mean Girls</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Parent Trap</em>). But making Anna a music-biz manager trying to keep her heartbroken client Ella (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) from a meltdown on the eve of a big concert at the Wiltern is just a laborious way of wedging Anna&rsquo;s former band, Pink Slip, into a splashy concert climax.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nGanatra and Weiss make everything feel a bit mechanical rather than an escalating spiral of craziness, and too many scenes play like montage fodder without actually taking the plot anywhere. That includes Anna getting to experience Harper&rsquo;s love of surfing; Tess taking a borrowed sports car for a reckless spin around L.A.; Lily stepping in for Tess in a vicious pickleball match; or Harper having to improvise in an immigration office interview to ascertain the legitimacy of Anna and Eric&rsquo;s marriage plans.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThat last scene yields some cringe-inducing comedy as the immigration officer (Santina Muha), fresh from a breakup, gets weepy over Chumbawamba&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tubthumping.&rdquo; And yes, &ldquo;pissing the night away&rdquo; is a phrase that might come to mind while watching this.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe nadir is Ella&rsquo;s photoshoot for a&nbsp;<em>Rolling Stone</em>&nbsp;feature &mdash; exactly what kind of pop star gets photographed dressed as a giant strawberry or a birthday cake? Oh right, Katy Perry &mdash; that gets hijacked by Anna/Harper and Tess/Lily when they raid the wardrobe racks for new looks more in keeping with their new inner selves.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe comedy seems even thinner when it starts depending on hideously ugly fashions for laughs &mdash; Lily, girl, if your taste runs to that denim monstrosity, good luck getting into fashion school. But never fear, costumer Natalie O&rsquo;Brien later puts Curtis into a garish pink ruched dress that almost makes the previous outfit forgivable.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe movie is possibly loud and colorful and zany and kooky and busy enough to mask the desperation in a script that shows little imagination for the psychological hurdles of people from three different generations struggling to understand one another.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nPartly because they&rsquo;re not revisiting roles from decades ago but forging their own characters, Butters (the pint-size Method actress on the Western set in Tarantino&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em>, now all grown up) and Hammons are appealing. Both squeeze some juice out of the incongruity of teenagers suddenly thrust into adult responsibilities.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nJacinto also brings easygoing warmth and a dash of poignancy to his role as the poster-boy fianc&eacute;. But if Harmon&rsquo;s Ryan seemed a bit wan in&nbsp;<em>Freaky Friday</em>, here he&rsquo;s so evanescent you forget he exists.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nDisney is hardly new to the business of calculated nostalgia, but the way this film shoehorns in&nbsp;Chad Michael Murray&rsquo;s character, Jake &mdash; despite it making zero plot sense to pull Anna&rsquo;s former high school flame back into the story &mdash; seems particularly shameless. His main function is to rediscover his former burning passion for Tess in scenes that made me turn away in embarrassment.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nNaturally, someone&rsquo;s going to say something platitudinous like &ldquo;Family is everything&rdquo; by the end, when all those differences that keep the characters at loggerheads melt away and a melding of the two families at last seems doable. But I think I would have preferred a shot-for-shot remake to this painfully stretched cash-grab.<br>",

Framed as a true story, it measures the shockwaves in a community when almost an entire class of elementary school children vanishes at the same time one night. It&rsquo;s even more reminiscent of King once a creepy figure in what looks like messy clown makeup starts making appearances. But any kinship with the master storyteller dissolves when the movie makes an abrupt swerve midway into witchy hag horror but fails to bolster that turn with compelling mythology.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nIn many ways, this is an expertly crafted chiller. It&rsquo;s shot by Larkin Seiple with atmospheric style to burn, full of snaking tracking sequences that exert a mesmerizing grip, and it makes commanding use of a gut-churning score by brothers Ryan and Hays Holladay and Cregger that covers a wide tonal range while building an unsettling soundscape. A strong cast and an intriguing chapter structure also work in its favor. But ultimately, it&rsquo;s not really about anything much.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nGiven the eerie phenomenon of children who leave their homes precisely at 2:17 a.m. &mdash; running through the darkened suburban streets with their arms outstretched like wings and then disappearing without a trace, strikingly accompanied by George Harrison&rsquo;s &ldquo;Beware of Darkness&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s conceivable that many will see it as an allegory for the shattering upheaval of tragedy that rips through towns across America with alarming frequency. The hypocrisy of a society continually looking for scapegoats to assign blame while refusing to examine its own dark heart provides a semblance of subtext.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-2\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article2-uid1\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-article2_0__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nNothing evokes gun violence and the worst parental fears like the sight of an empty classroom. But aside from a simmering&nbsp;Josh Brolin&nbsp;as grieving father Archer seeing a vision of a giant semi-automatic in the night sky flashing the time of the unexplained event, there&rsquo;s too little substance to support those associations.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThat might not matter to the core audience since the twisty, twisted film delivers more of the unpredictable narrative energy that made&nbsp;<em>Barbarian</em>&nbsp;so bracing. (One of the stars of that film turns up in a brief cameo.) But&nbsp;<em>Weapons</em>&nbsp;is far more consistently weird than scary, which might leave some genre freaks feeling unsatisfied.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nWhatever its flaws,&nbsp;<em>Weapons</em>&nbsp;unquestionably fortifies the impression that Cregger is a gifted genre director working with complete control as he shifts between enveloping dread and macabre humor.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nJustine Gandy (Julia Garner) is as surprised as anyone when she shows up at Maybrook Elementary one morning to find only one of her 18 students in attendance, Alex (Cary Christopher). Both teacher and student are questioned by police, as is headmaster Marcus (Benedict Wong). Security camera footage from the homes of missing kids reveals disturbing images of them running toward, rather than away from something, but concrete leads are elusive.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAmong the most hostile voices at a town hall meeting at which shocked parents want answers is Archer, who insists that the teacher must somehow be responsible. Once the school reopens after an investigation period, Justine wants to resume teaching, but Marcus persuades her to lie low until the anger dies down. That doesn&rsquo;t protect her from threatening phone calls, harrassment, the word &ldquo;witch&rdquo; graffitied across the side of her car in red paint and even an enraged mother physically attacking her at the liquor store.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nJustine becomes a frequent customer there, hitting the vodka hard and coaxing her occasional hookup, young cop Paul (Alden Ehrenreich, terrific), to slide off the wagon. Garner slyly plays up the character&rsquo;s duality, her slender frame hiding considerable strength and her tenderness toward the children she teaches contrasted with a tough, brittle side provoked by the suspicions cast upon her.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nCregger effectively replays events from the days following the mass disappearance from different perspectives in chapters named for the characters whose point of view they adopt.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nIn the &ldquo;Justine&rdquo; section, she refuses to be intimidated by Marcus&rsquo; warnings, and after being forbidden from talking to Alex, she follows him home where she stumbles on another mystery. The windows are all obscured by newspapers and when no-one answers the front door, she peers inside through a gap and is startled to see what appears to be Alex&rsquo;s parents sitting on the couch in the dark staring blankly in a catatonic state.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nChapters follow titled &ldquo;Archer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; &ldquo;Marcus&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alex,&rdquo; along with one called &ldquo;James.&rdquo; Played by Austin Abrams with the wiry desperation and cunning of an addict, James is an unhoused junkie living in a tent in the woods, who has a nasty brush with Paul. But when James learns of the $50,000 reward being offered for information on the vanished children, he sees an opportunity. In the meantime, he needs drug money so starts breaking into houses, including the home of Alex&rsquo;s family.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe less you know going forward the better, aside from the fact that people are driven by dark forces to acts of extreme violence, the most seemingly benign of them becoming the most brutal. Justine and Archer become unlikely allies once he witnesses her being attacked and their amateur sleuthing leads them in the right direction. Only in the penultimate chapter does a new character appear, who sheds a whole new light on what&rsquo;s happening, if not why. There&rsquo;s a bizarre Lynchian quality to the climactic events even if Cregger&rsquo;s fondness for grotesque comedy takes the edge off the terror.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nExpecting an audience to be spooked by a sinister figure who&rsquo;s like Phyllis Diller crossed with Friar Tuck and Amy Sedaris&rsquo; Jerri Blank on&nbsp;<em>Strangers with Candy</em>&nbsp;is a tall order. But the movie is never dull or cripplingly silly and it looks sensational. Dynamic cinematographer Seiple&rsquo;s visuals are loaded with rich textures and sinuous movement. The extensive use of practical effects over CG is another asset.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nCregger&rsquo;s confident direction and the maniacal commitment of the actor in that late-arrival role allow the comedy to co-exist with horrific violence and escalating suspense in a concluding stretch with a dash of&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Flies</em>. It&rsquo;s as explosively bloody, viscerally charged and masterfully choreographed a denouement as that of&nbsp;any horror movie in recent memory.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nWhat does the ominously glowing blue triangle in the title graphic mean? Who knows, beyond generic occultism. But that&rsquo;s indicative of the lack of depth that holds Cregger back, suggesting that a more psychologically probing co-writer might elevate him into the ranks of the great horror visionaries.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-11-1\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid3\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-7\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid2\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

    "summary": "A new documentary examines the life, death and enduring appeal of the legendary singer-songwriter.",
    "content": "On a Monday night in late spring of 1992,&nbsp;Jeff Buckley&nbsp;arrived at the tiny Cafe Sin-&eacute; on New York&rsquo;s St. Mark&rsquo;s Place with a borrowed Fender Telecaster and a story to tell. He had scored a prestigious weekly gig at the East Village mainstay that had hosted both Irish rock royalty (Sinead O&rsquo;Connor, Shane McGowan, the Waterboys), as well as up-and-coming talent, and the 25-year-old appeared ready to meet the moment.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nHe set up against the wall in a corner, waved a shy hello to the small crowd, opened his mouth to sing and that&rsquo;s the moment when all hell broke loose. The raw power of his voice overwhelmed the space, alternating between a feminine falsetto and masculine growl&mdash;often within the same song. His guitar playing, too, had elements of punk and blues, but with Eastern flavoring woven throughout. In other words, he threw the kitchen sink at the unsuspecting audience.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-1\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\nWithin weeks of Jeff Buckley&rsquo;s first solo show in New York, even the most jaded local&nbsp;<a id=\"auto-tag_music_1\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/music/\">music</a>&nbsp;fans were left to wonder how we&rsquo;d ever lived without him. His impact was seismic and remained so until his death five years later, in May of 1997, while swimming fully clothed in the Mississippi River.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nA new&nbsp;documentary&nbsp;from Amy Berg,&nbsp;<em>It&rsquo;s Never Over, Jeff Buckley</em>, comes out this week and spends nearly two hours trying to unpack the conundrum of his legacy, with never-before-seen live footage as well as interviews with artists, industry execs, friends and family. For his most ardent fans, it&rsquo;s a welcome snapshot of a complicated man who was kind and inquisitive, who probably suffered from depression and who craved and was ultimately tortured by attention. It captures a person whose death had a profound impact on those who knew him best. The film also confirmed that Buckley&rsquo;s wellspring of art was likely deep and profound. And largely untapped.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe phenomenon of artists dying young is nothing new &mdash; Hendrix, Joplin, Morrison and Cobain are all charter members of the &ldquo;27 club.&rdquo; Even Buckley&rsquo;s own father, folk singer Tim Buckley, was only 28 years old when he fatally overdosed on heroin.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nWhat&rsquo;s different about Jeff Buckley may be the key to unlocking the mystery of his enduring appeal: None of those other artists left as little evidence behind of their genius for people to dissect. So much is still unknowable about him because he was still early in his creative journey when he died.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nHe recorded one nearly perfect album and then &hellip; nothing.&nbsp;His career was like a baseball player hitting a walk-off grand slam in his first-ever at-bat and then retiring.&nbsp;Time never gave Buckley a chance to strike out.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nWith a five-octave vocal range, preternatural charm and a razor-sharp wit,&nbsp;Buckley&rsquo;s extraordinary live performances at downtown clubs became the stuff of legend. The growing crowds swooned from his setlists in which he covered songs from Edith Piaf to Van Morrison to Nina Simone to Led Zeppelin.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nInvariably, Buckley&rsquo;s sweaty, intense shows would conclude with him alone in the spotlight, performing Leonard Cohen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; which may have been the first mic drop.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nI saw Buckley play at Sin-&eacute; early in his run and was so dumbstruck by his performance that I followed him for more than a year as he played venues like Fez, CBGB, Under Acme, the Knitting Factory, St. Ann&rsquo;s Church in Brooklyn and Maxwell&rsquo;s in Hoboken.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nSince iPhones and social media channels were non-existent then, you really needed to bring others to experience it for themselves. There was no way to contextualize his performances because there was no other performer to compare him to. And so, herding my friends to Jeff Buckley gigs became my hobby.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nIn fall of 1994, I spent part of an afternoon interviewing Buckley for a regional New York music newspaper, an assignment for which I was paid zero dollars minus expenses.&nbsp;He was in the midst of mixing his debut album&nbsp;<em>Grace</em>, just weeks before its release.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nIt was an unguarded conversation, since the stakes for talking to a guy from a small regional newspaper were fairly low. You could probably reach a larger audience by shouting from your kitchen window.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nHaving seen me at the gigs, he was curious about my heightened level of interest. I replied semi-facetiously that I was trying to make sense of what I was seeing, and it was simply taking longer than I&rsquo;d anticipated. &ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; he replied, with a lopsided smile.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nOver the years, Jeff Buckley has been so difficult to pigeonhole as an artist because he was sui generis: He was Plant&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>Page; he was Reed&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;Cale; he was Buckingham&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;Nicks. His music is not rooted to a time period or genre profile. Quite the opposite.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThere was a reason that Robert Plant called Buckley&rsquo;s talent &ldquo;mind-altering&rdquo; and that seeing Buckley perform live in London sent Thom Yorke and Radiohead directly into the studio to record &ldquo;Fake Plastic Trees.&rdquo; Buckley&rsquo;s original songs were so genre-bending and sonically out there that they could appeal to both Bad Brains fans and Judy Garland devotees.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nMost music fans must contend with the unease of seeing their favorite artists age out of relevance. But Jeff Buckley&rsquo;s legacy is frozen in time, as a 30-year singer-songwriter whose best days were ahead of him. There are no mugshots, unflattering interviews or half-assed tours to tarnish his legacy.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nHe is, and will remain, one of the greatest &ldquo;what if&rdquo; stories in modern music.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

    "content": "Chappell Roan may have released three new singles since her debut album, but she is now revealing that fans likely won&rsquo;t get to hear her second full album for &ldquo;at least five&rdquo; years.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nShe spoke to&nbsp;<em>Vogue</em>&nbsp;while on set of the&nbsp;music&nbsp;video for her latest single,&nbsp;&ldquo;The Subway,&rdquo;&nbsp;where she said that her &ldquo;second project doesn&rsquo;t exist yet.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nRoan&rsquo;s debut album,&nbsp;<em>The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess</em>, was released in September 2023. The album was critically acclaimed and earned six Grammy nominations. She also took home the Grammy for best new artist at the 2025 ceremony.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nDespite releasing &ldquo;The Subway,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Giver&rdquo; and &ldquo;Good Luck, Babe&rdquo; after her debut album&rsquo;s release, Roan said &ldquo;there is no album&rdquo; and &ldquo;no collection of songs.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;It took me five years to write the first one, and it&rsquo;s probably going to take at least five to write the next,&rdquo; she said of her sophomore album. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that type of writer that can pump it out.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nRoan added that she doesn&rsquo;t think she makes &ldquo;good music whenever I force myself to do anything.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;I see some comments sometimes, like, &lsquo;She&rsquo;s everywhere except that damn studio,&rsquo;&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Even if I was in the studio 12 hours a day, every single day, that does not mean that you would get an album any faster.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nRoan went on to reveal that &ldquo;The Subway&rdquo; also &ldquo;took an annoying amount of time to get just right.&rdquo; While reflecting on why the writing and producing process took so long, she said, &ldquo;I just wasn&rsquo;t ready to put it out yet. It was just too painful. I was just too angry and scared &mdash; just about my life &mdash; to put it out.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nShe&rsquo;s now she&rsquo;s in a better place, which she partially credits to staying off of social media. &ldquo;Socials harm the fuck out of me and my art. I&rsquo;m not doing that to myself anymore,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never written an album where I don&rsquo;t have Instagram or anything. The album process is purely, only mine. No one on TikTok gets to see it.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nRoan first debuted &ldquo;The Subway&rdquo; during her performance at Governors Ball in New York City in June of 2024. However, she didn&rsquo;t release the song on streaming platforms until July 31.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very proud of this song &amp; what a journey she has been on,&rdquo; she wrote on Instagram when she first dropped the track. &ldquo;I first played it at gov ball when I was painted green as lady liberty and in the past have played new songs live to feel them out.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nShe released the Amber Grace Johnson-directed&nbsp;music video on Aug. 1, which showed her making her way through New York City as she looked back on a broken heart on the subway.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-1\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Freese wrote a statement on his&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;late Wednesday night celebrating his reunion.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;Leaving Nine Inch Nails at the end of 2008 was one of the hardest decisions I&rsquo;ve ever had to make,&rdquo; Freese wrote.

    "content": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very excited,&rdquo; K-pop star XngHan tells&nbsp;<em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>&nbsp;about his solo debut. &ldquo;My heart swoons.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe 21-year-old, officially making his solo debut today with his artist project XngHan and Xoul, is equal parts excited and optimistic on a Zoom call from his label SM Entertainment&rsquo;s Seoul headquarters as he speaks of his new chapter as a soloist.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nXngHan&rsquo;s debut has been highly anticipated by much of the K-pop community. Late last year, it was announced that the K-pop star, who previously went by his name Seunghan, would be leaving the boy group Riize, just days after the news of his return from a lengthy hiatus. When it was later announced that he&rsquo;d be debuting as a soloist, XngHan received genuine well wishes from fans across various K-pop fandoms &ndash; somewhat of a rarity in online&nbsp;<a id=\"auto-tag_music_1\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/music/\">music</a> spaces these days.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nXngHan&rsquo;s first single, &ldquo;Waste No Time,&rdquo; is a pitch-perfect choice for his debut track. As the singer puts it, the &ldquo;refreshing&rdquo; summer song talks of not wasting any time and spreading his &ldquo;boundless wings&rdquo; &ndash; perhaps a perfect parallel to XngHan himself, who seems eager to tackle this new chapter head-on. The single is accompanied by a B-Side, &ldquo;Heavenly Blue,&rdquo; is similarly catchy and the perfect soundtrack for a sunny summer day. XngHan contributed to writing lyrics and choreographing for the song.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nBelow, the XngHan speaks with THR about &ldquo;Waste No Time&rdquo; and &ldquo;Heavenly Blue,&rdquo; his exit from Riize and what his hopes for the future.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>I think there are a lot of people who are eager to hear how you&rsquo;re doing these days. How are you feeling ahead of your debut?</strong><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nI made sure that I worked out. I&rsquo;ve been practicing my dance skills and also my vocals, so that I can keep everything rolling and going. My solo debut is just around the corner, so I&rsquo;m very excited. My heart swoons.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>You seem very happy. To talk about your future, I think we need to talk a bit about the past. How are you feeling, looking back on what I assume has been an at times difficult year? How do you feel looking ahead?</strong><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nI used that time to look back on myself. I think it was a time given to me for more self-improvement, so I was really using that time to make sure that I got better at stuff. I think it was a time where I was trying to get ready for a new start, so I think all the things I learned along the way are definitely going to be something that I can use going forward as a fuel, so I&rsquo;m very excited and looking forward to my debut as a soloist.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<div class=\"post-content-image //  \">\r\n<figure class=\"o-figure   size-large alignnone lrv-u-max-width-100p\">\r\n<div class=\"c-lazy-image  \">\r\n<div class=\"lrv-a-crop-16x9\"><img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-03-XngHanXoul.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1250\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption class=\"c-figcaption  lrv-u-padding-tb-025\">XngHan for his debut single, &ldquo;Waste No Time.&rdquo;&nbsp;<cite class=\"a-font-accent-uppercase-xs lrv-u-color-grey-dark\">Courtesy of SM Entertainment<br><br></cite></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n<strong>I think there are a lot of people who are really excited to see you debut and have been waiting for it since your time with Riize. Although you&rsquo;re no longer with Riize, you worked and trained alongside them. Do you have any wishes for them? But also what hopes do you have for yourself as a soloist?</strong><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nI know that Riize is doing so well, and] I&rsquo;m rooting for them as a fellow artist. I hope they stay healthy and well. [Since] I&rsquo;m also preparing my new launch as a soloist, I hope people stay tuned [for my debut]. I&rsquo;m really going to pour my heart and soul into this.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-10\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid2\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_5__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>Why was it so important for you to change your stage name? Do you see this as opening a new chapter for you?</strong><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nYeah, it&rsquo;s exactly as you said. I think it&rsquo;s a new chapter for me, a new challenge for me, and I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to it. The reason why I wanted to include the letter X is because it symbolizes infinite potentials, [an] infinity of possibilities. It&rsquo;s also the unknown variable when it comes to mathematical formulas. I think it symbolizes that I am now opening up the doors to all the different potentials and possibilities that I could dig into. I wanted to use this letter X to show that. I think with this new artist brand, I can show you different facets of myself.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>How has your training been? What do you feel like you&rsquo;ve been focusing on in terms of practicing for your debut &ldquo;Waste No Time&rdquo; the most?</strong><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nI guess the focus in training for this single was that it had to be fun. It&rsquo;s a very vibing kind of song, so I wanted to give it that refreshing mood and vibe. Especially since it&rsquo;s a summer song. Actually, the good thing was that it wasn&rsquo;t very challenging to get ready for these songs. It was actually a very fun experience for me, especially since I got to work together with Xoul, the dance crew comprised of two people. It was really fun. It was almost like we were just playing around, but we were making something and creating something. I felt very much at ease preparing for the songs.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>Can you tell me about your collaboration with Xoul? Do you find yourself feeling a little more comfortable working alongside them, given you&rsquo;ve previously worked in a group setting?</strong><br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-15-1\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid3\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_6__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nYeah, it&rsquo;s definitely a lot more comfortable [especially] because our interests align. These are two professional dancers, so all three of us are bonded by our love and passion for dance. We would be working [on choreography], but we&rsquo;d also be having a lot of fun dancing. It just made me feel so comfortable and at home working together with them.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<div class=\"post-content-image //  \">\r\n<figure class=\"o-figure   size-large alignnone lrv-u-max-width-100p\">\r\n<div class=\"c-lazy-image  \">\r\n<div class=\"lrv-a-crop-16x9\"><img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-07-XngHanXoul_Single_Waste-No-Time_Teaser_Image.jpg?w=1500\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption class=\"c-figcaption  lrv-u-padding-tb-025\">XngHan and his dancers, known collectively as Xoul.&nbsp;<cite class=\"a-font-accent-uppercase-xs lrv-u-color-grey-dark\">Courtesy of SM Entertainment</cite></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>How did this concept that you would have a dance crew with you come about? Why did you feel it made the most sense for you right now?</strong><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nI thought long and hard about with whom I should collaborate, and I think my top priority was to bring to the table something new, something refreshing, something people haven&rsquo;t seen before. I myself love trying new things and that&rsquo;s how we got to brainstorming ideas. Then I thought my forte is definitely performance, so why don&rsquo;t I start from there and gather a group of professional dancers, and that&rsquo;s how I gathered my first batch of Xoul.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>How do you envision this looking like for you going forward in the future?</strong><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nOne of the ideas that I have in mind&hellip; I&rsquo;ve always had this dream of creating a band, so that could be one idea. But right now I&rsquo;m going to really focus on the Xoul dancers. We&rsquo;re just going to nail the performances.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nI have a lot of time ahead of me, and I think I have a lot of potential, a lot of possibilities. I&rsquo;m going to open it up to all the different things that I could do.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>Do you feel you&rsquo;ve had any big changes in the way you work? Did you realize any new strengths during your debut preparation?</strong><br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-22-2\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid4\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_7__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nWhen I was working on this debut, there&rsquo;s the B-side track called &ldquo;Heavenly Blue,&rdquo; and I contributed to writing the lyrics for the song. I also created the choreography together with Xoul. It was my first time trying to pen the words of my own song, and I realized that I&rsquo;m actually pretty good at it. I think I do have a little bit of a forte in writing [lyrics].<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>I think for any soloist, it&rsquo;s a bit daunting, having to figure out who you&rsquo;ll be as a singer. What was that process like for you?</strong><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nI&rsquo;d like to be a soloist who appears the same on and off stage. I changed the S in my name to an X, but it&rsquo;s actually not that different sonically because it&rsquo;s still Seunghan. I want to be a soloist who can really be his true self on stage and show his true colors and essence. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to go for.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>&ldquo;Waste No Time&rdquo; is so much fun and a great debut single. Why did you feel like it was the right fit?</strong><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe genre of the track is electronic dance, which incorporates a wide range of sounds. That&rsquo;s something I liked about the song, and it was in line with the kind of concept that I wanted to go with. When I thought about performance, I thought this was a song that could really mesh well with the performance that I can show on stage. When I heard the demo of the song, I knew right away that this was the right one. From the very beginning, I really wanted this song to be my debut track.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<div class=\"post-content-image //  \">\r\n<figure class=\"o-figure   size-large alignnone lrv-u-max-width-100p\">\r\n<div class=\"c-lazy-image  \">\r\n<div class=\"lrv-a-crop-16x9\"><img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-12-XngHanXoul_Single_Waste-No-Time_Teaser_Image.jpg?w=1500\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption class=\"c-figcaption  lrv-u-padding-tb-025\">XngHan and Xoul.&nbsp;<cite class=\"a-font-accent-uppercase-xs lrv-u-color-grey-dark\">Courtesy of SM Entertainment</cite></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>Can you tell me a bit about working on choreography for this project and what that experience was like?</strong><br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-28-3\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid5\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_8__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nTo be honest, it was quite challenging in the beginning because it was my first time and [Xoul&rsquo;s] first time collaborating. We all had our own style, so it was very hard to come to a consensus in the beginning. But I realized that I was the one who had to lead the debate, so I orchestrated [the process] between us three, and they were very happy to give me a lot of ideas. I was happy to share my ideas, even the very bizarre ones. We had a lot of fun sharing and tossing around ideas and coming up with the choreography.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>To look ahead &ndash; you&rsquo;re at a new starting line, which can be nerve-wrecking but at the same time, very exciting. What are you hoping the future looks like for you as a soloist? What are your aspirations for the year ahead?</strong><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nMaybe it&rsquo;s a little early to say this, but my ultimate dream and goal is to drop an album where I creatively contributed in all the different aspects of all the tracks, including the choreography and writing the lyrics and the composition of the songs. That&rsquo;s my ultimate dream. [Also] to have that album drop and perform it live and receive the love and support of the fans. That&rsquo;s my dream.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>As an artist, people&rsquo;s perception of you is often out of your control, but you&rsquo;re a human being and an artist. You&rsquo;ve put a great deal of work into this debut and likely have an idea of how you want people to feel. How are you hoping to be viewed as an artist?</strong><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nI just hope that when fans watch my performance and see me performing live, they get so excited and happy. They can&rsquo;t help but dance. That&rsquo;s what I want the fans to view me as. When I&rsquo;m on stage, I want to be remembered as an artist who just lights the stage on fire and nails every performance.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-33-4\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid6\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_9__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>Speaking of fans, do you have a message to the fans who have been eagerly awaiting your debut and supporting you from afar for a while now?</strong><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThank you for the long wait.

His 2019 single &ldquo;One Less Day (Dying Young)&rdquo; came from losing friends and peers, then on 2021&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Something About Christmas Time,&nbsp;</em>he dedicated &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Feel Like Christmas (Samy&rsquo;s Song)&rdquo; to his late Pomeranian Samy. In April, Thomas and his wife of 25 years, Marisol Thomas,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DIe7IsnRfsl/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">lost their beloved &ldquo;Gingey&rdquo; Ollie</a>, kickstarting a challenging new chapter of life without any of their fur babies.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-10\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid2\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_5__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nNavigating such obstacles is something the couple, who run animal rescue organization&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sidewalkangelsfoundation.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cemillman%40thr.com%7C3d8b30d6206b43e324d208ddbf661dc0%7Ce950f25546e44144a778a6ff4f557492%7C0%7C0%7C638877167487462664%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=gqKfc6U1JEHpUnuotiXka4IX7npapPsj1Xi9u7OVm8o%3D&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Sidewalk Angels Foundation</a>, have taken in stride since meeting at a Matchbox Twenty afterparty in 1998. Within years of their nuptials, Marisol began experiencing debilitating health issues that eventually saw her diagnosed with Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses. She continues facing health struggles, which often makes it &ldquo;hard to be happy,&rdquo; for Thomas.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nHe honors their enduring love in the sweet, stirring ballad &ldquo;<a href=\"https://rob-thomas.lnk.to/HardHappy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Thrill Me,&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;co-written with Tim Lopez from Plain White T&rsquo;s and partly inspired by Shania Twain.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;I used to love &lsquo;You&rsquo;re Still the One&rsquo; and that sentiment,&rdquo; says Thomas. &ldquo;The reason why [relationships] sometimes don&rsquo;t work out is because people are ever-evolving. If you&rsquo;re lucky, both of you evolve in the same direction, or are willing to accept the changes happening to each other. When that happens, it&rsquo;s magical.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like with happiness: Commitment and staying together is something people have to agree on and work at a bit. But I don&rsquo;t prescribe to the idea that it takes work all the time. If that&rsquo;s the case, don&rsquo;t get married, dude!&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nCo-produced by Greg Wattenberg,&nbsp;<em>All Night Days&nbsp;</em>marks Thomas&rsquo; first album&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/rob-thomas-signs-with-universal-leaves-atlantic-records-1236310645/\">since leaving Atlantic Records for Universal Records</a>.&nbsp;Songs written during Matchbox Twenty&rsquo;s sessions include blood-pumping banger &ldquo;I Believe It&rdquo; (penned by Wattenberg and Thomas&rsquo; bandmates Kyle Cook, Paul Doucette and Brian Yale) and heart-wrenching &ldquo;No Good at Loving You,&rdquo; inspired by marriage.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-15-1\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid3\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_6__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThere&rsquo;s someone else who Thomas has loved almost as long as Marisol &mdash; his 1999 &ldquo;Smooth&rdquo; collaborator Carlos Santana. Thanks to the Grammy-winning track, Santana and music mogul Clive Davis became lifelong mentors who &ldquo;helped me center myself, to get where I want to be.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nDuring Monday&rsquo;s production rehearsals, Thomas felt the lighting wasn&rsquo;t right for &ldquo;Smooth.&rdquo; &ldquo;So, I wrote to Carlos saying, &lsquo;Hey man, what color is &ldquo;Smooth&rdquo;?&rsquo; Thirty seconds later, he writes back, &lsquo;Diamond ice.&rsquo; &nbsp;I said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s beautiful. Thanks for your help!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAs well as &ldquo;Smooth,&rdquo; Matchbox Twenty hits and new tracks, Thomas&rsquo; setlist will celebrate the 20th anniversary of his solo debut,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://robthomasmusic.com/releases/something-to-be-deluxe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>&hellip;Something to Be</em></a>. The album spawned Grammy-nominated hits like &ldquo;This Is How a Heart Breaks&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lonely No More,&rdquo; plus John Mayer collaboration &ldquo;Streetcorner Symphony.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nSo, 20 years later, did Rob Thomas find &hellip; something to be?<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;I think the becoming is in the searching,&rdquo; he reflects. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no destination or peak to get to. When we started out, nobody knew who we were, but we&rsquo;d play the college club and it felt fucking awesome. Then you get signed and you&rsquo;re playing radio festivals, but at noon, and it&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Who cares? This is still fucking great.&rsquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;If that had been the peak, I would&rsquo;ve happily looked back telling people, &lsquo;I was in a band, we had a good run and it was fun.&rsquo; It still just feels fun. When you&rsquo;re looking ahead trying to figure out [something to be] or that destination to get to, you&rsquo;re not looking at your feet and appreciating the moment you&rsquo;re in &mdash; and the little wonders.&rdquo;<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-21-2\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid4\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_7__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nIt&rsquo;s a lesson for his son from a previous relationship, Maison Thomas-Eudy, who&rsquo;s 27 and carving out his own musical path. While A Great Big World is joining Thomas on tour, Maison&rsquo;s L.A. pop rock trio The Lucky will also open select shows<em>,&nbsp;</em>including one at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fontainebleaulasvegas.com/entertainment/rob-thomas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Fountainebleau Las Vegas</a>&nbsp;on album release day.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nMaison &mdash; who played guitar on several&nbsp;<em>All Night Days&nbsp;</em>songs, including the snappy standout title track &mdash; is also Thomas&rsquo; new guitarist, thanks to previous guitarist Frank Romano suggesting the Berklee graduate as his replacement.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nFor Thomas, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;weird&rdquo; adjustment hugging Maison goodbye as he heads off with the band each night, instead of sticking with him. It was a different story during Matchbox Twenty&rsquo;s 2024 Australian tour, when the two bonded during shopping trips, movies and poolside lunches.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;We solidified the friendship part of our relationship in Australia,&rdquo; says Thomas. &ldquo;We got to know each other and who we are now. He&rsquo;s one of the closest people in the world to me and one of the best humans I know &mdash; so kind and thoughtful. I couldn&rsquo;t ask for anything more.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nMaison, meanwhile, credits Thomas for instilling key lessons in building a fruitful music career.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;He&rsquo;s taught me a lot about effort, what it takes to succeed, to always work on being better and never say you can&rsquo;t do something,&rdquo; Maison tells&nbsp;<em>THR</em>. &ldquo;I almost said &lsquo;No&rsquo; to filling in for Frankie because I thought his shoes were too big to fill, but I&rsquo;m glad I said &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; because I&rsquo;m having a blast.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAfter wrapping the U.S. leg of the tour at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.com/rob-thomas-the-all-night-days-inglewood-california-09-06-2025/event/0A0062A194D7474D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">L.A.&rsquo;s YouTube Theater</a>&nbsp;on Sept. 6, Thomas will tour Australia and New Zealand. He&rsquo;s also preparing to mark 30 years since Matchbox Twenty&rsquo;s 1996 debut,&nbsp;<em>Yourself or Someone Like You.</em><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nIn a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://earofnewt.com/2021/08/02/that-time-rob-thomas-told-me-that-what-sets-matchbox-20-apart-from-all-the-other-rock-bands-with-debut-albums-is-penis-size/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">newly resurfaced interview clip</a>, a 25-year-old Thomas credited &ldquo;penis size&rdquo; for setting Matchbox Twenty apart from other new rock bands. But ultimately, it&rsquo;s chart-toppers like &ldquo;3AM,&rdquo; &ldquo;Long Day&rdquo; and &ldquo;Push&rdquo; that laid the foundation for the group&rsquo;s legacy, fanbase and subsequent records. With Doucette admirably encouraging Thomas to dedicate ample time to&nbsp;<em>All Night Days,&nbsp;</em>Thomas doesn&rsquo;t anticipate anniversary celebrations commencing until mid-late 2026.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;End of next year is when we&rsquo;ll really start things, then the next year we&rsquo;re going out properly and doing special things,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not interested in making another album right now because we might kill each other, but maybe we&rsquo;ll come up with a song or two. We also want to have some fun with old live recordings.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nHowever, there&rsquo;s one recording that still needs to go down. After Ryan Gosling&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8Y57NWv5m0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">repeatedly belted out &ldquo;Push&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;in 2023&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Barbie</em>, fans remain eager to see Gosling perform the song with Thomas.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;Listen, if I could&rsquo;ve done that, I would&rsquo;ve already left Mari and be with him right now,&rdquo; laughs Thomas. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an attractive man.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-32-4\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid6\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_9__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see about getting Ryan Gosling to the show to sing with us,&rdquo; Thomas then instructs his manager, who promptly takes note ahead of the tour hitting California, where Gosling resides. &ldquo;If that happened, you&rsquo;d be witnessing the bromance of the ages. He would eclipse my love of Taylor Kitsch. Sorry Taylor!&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nKitsch may drop in Thomas&rsquo; man crush rankings, but one thing&rsquo;s for sure &mdash; a Rob x Ryan collab wouldn&rsquo;t make it hard to be happy for fans.<br>",

    "summary": "The audio streaming giant, led by CEO Daniel Ek, posts its second-quarter results, which were hit by higher expenses and costs related to stock gains, pushing company shares lower in pre-market trading.",
    "content": "Audio&nbsp;streaming&nbsp;giant&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;posted second-quarter subscriber gains to end June with 276 million paying premium subscribers, up from 268 million as of the end of the first quarter in March. Monthly active users (MAUs) grew to 696 million from 678 million. Management had previously forecast 273 million premium subs and 689 million MAUs.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;In the first half of 2025, subscriber net additions grew more than 30 percent compared to the first half of 2024, and this marks the company&rsquo;s second-highest second quarter for MAU net additions,&rdquo; Spotify said on Tuesday. MAUs were driven by &ldquo;growth across all regions, with outperformance led by Rest of the World, Latin America and Europe.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-1\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\nHowever, in its latest earnings report, the company also posted a quarterly loss rather than a predicted profit, which had been expected given that the company has been boosting its bottom line with price increases,&nbsp;cost reductions, and a recent pullback from exclusive podcast deals in favor of non-exclusive pacts (case in point:&nbsp;Joe Rogan).<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nBut the firm reported a swing from a &euro;274 million year-ago profit to a second-quarter loss of &euro;86 million ($100 million), or 42 euro cents per share, as its operating expenses rose 8 percent to &euro;914 million ($1.06 billion). Drivers of the profit hit were increased personnel, professional services and marketing costs, as well as what the company calls &ldquo;social charges,&rdquo; meaning payroll taxes that go up with the firm&rsquo;s stock price. As such, Spotify was the victim of its recent share gains.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nSpotify shares fell in Tuesday pre-market trading.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nSpotify&rsquo;s second-quarter revenue jumped 10 percent to &euro;4.19 billion ($4.85 billion), led by a 12 percent gain in premium revenue. Advertising-supported revenue, seen as a growth opportunity, dropped slightly.&nbsp;Spotify CEO Daniel Ek pointing to advertising as a current weak spot in the business on the earnings call, even as the company noted it has grown monthly active advertisers by more than 40% year over year.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;The one area that hasn&rsquo;t yet met our expectations is our ads business. We&rsquo;ve simply been moving too slowly, and it&rsquo;s taken longer than expected to see the improvements we initiated to take hold. It&rsquo;s really an execution challenge, not a problem with the strategy,&rdquo; Ek said on the call.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nEk&nbsp;touted growth initiatives on Tuesday after cautious near-term guidance during the first-quarter update. &ldquo;The short term may bring some noise,&rdquo; he had said back then. &ldquo;But we remain confident in the long-term story, and the direction we&rsquo;re heading in feels clearer than ever.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nOn Tuesday, he said: &ldquo;People come to Spotify and they stay on Spotify. By constantly evolving, we create more and more value for the almost 700 million people using our platform. This value not only benefits users but it&rsquo;s attracting more people to streaming and as a result, it&rsquo;s also boosted the industries of&nbsp;music, podcasts, and audiobooks.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe company also highlighted Spotify&rsquo;s emphasis on video, with the company now boasting 430,000 video podcasts on Spotify, which continues to outperform with consumption growing 20 times faster than audio-only consumption since 2024.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-9\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid2\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_3__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nFor the current third quarter, Spotify projected that its MAUs would grow to 710 million, with premium subscribers reaching 281 million.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nSpotify&rsquo;s stock recently hit an all-time high of $785.00, giving the company a market value of around $160&nbsp;billion, amid investor optimism in the company&rsquo;s outlook before a drop in recent days.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nEvercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney used the headline &ldquo;Will The Record Skip?&rdquo; for his earnings preview, highlighting such financial risks as a negative foreign-exchange impact from the weakening U.S. dollar, given that Spotify reports its financials in euros, and &ldquo;material social charges given the run-up in shares.&rdquo; He maintained his &ldquo;outperform&rdquo; rating and $750 stock price target on Spotify.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nBut Bernstein analyst Ian Moore recently reiterated his &ldquo;outperform&rdquo; rating with a higher $840 stock price target, citing &ldquo;underappreciated pricing power and superfan upside.&rdquo; He concluded: &ldquo;While we expect foreign exchange to weigh moderately on premium average revenue per user and top-line growth versus guidance and expectations in the quarter and for the remainder of the year, user metrics and tailwinds from price increases should deliver.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nNetflix last week&nbsp;unveiled&nbsp;a promotional deal with Spotify for the video streaming giant&rsquo;s Adam Sandler film&nbsp;<em>Happy Gilmore 2</em>. As a result, Spotify users are able to play an interactive audio-visual game called the Happy Gilmore 2 Tournament, which allows them to, by tilting their phones, chip golf balls, navigate moments from the movie, and unlock audio clips.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

The broadcaster said while not &ldquo;an easy decision,&rdquo; it was &ldquo;the right thing to do&rdquo; for the chefs who took part.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nBroadcast union Bectu railed against the decision, claiming bad behavior &ldquo;should not be rewarded&rdquo; with prime-time coverage. &ldquo;Whilst the BBC claims that it has consulted with contestants there appears to have been no consultation with complainants; freelancers who have taken the very difficult step of speaking out and who will legitimately feel distressed,&rdquo; Bectu head Philippa Childs said.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-2\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article2-uid1\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-article2_0__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nElsewhere, U.K. culture secretary Lisa Nandy told&nbsp;<em>BBC Breakfast</em>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s absolutely not for me, as the culture secretary and a member of the government, to tell broadcasters what they can and can&rsquo;t broadcast.&rdquo; However, as a viewer, she added, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be watching it.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nBoth Wallace and Torode appear from the outset and throughout the new series, but critics have noted there are fewer jokes and less banter between the men and their chefs compared to previous instalments.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&ldquo;John and Gregg are there to explain things to camera, link parts of the programme and review the food, but they&rsquo;re not there so much for our entertainment,&rdquo; said British TV critic Scott Bryan. The promotional image on the BBC&rsquo;s streaming service shows the&nbsp;<em>MasterChef&nbsp;</em>trophy, unlike previous years where Wallace and Torode would feature.<br>",

There are enough expositional reminders here for a general catch-up, but the truth is that the&nbsp;new season of&nbsp;<em>Wednesday</em>&nbsp;is so generic that my biggest challenge was separating my memory of the first season from nearly identical dynamics that played out in&nbsp;<em>The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</em> and the overall run of Harry Potter.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nGoing back to my first paragraph: I think it&rsquo;s completely legitimate to have had those particular preferences, in which case the first four episodes of this two-part&nbsp;<em>Wednesday</em>&nbsp;season will probably satisfy you. But if you found most of the appeal of the first season to be Ortega&rsquo;s breakout performance, a few of the supporting turns and residual traces of&nbsp;Tim Burton&lsquo;s darkly comic eccentricity, this is a large letdown. It&rsquo;s more of the same, only more convoluted and less Ortega-y &mdash; which, I assume, was what the busy young thespian wanted, but not what this viewer hoped for.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe Alfred Gough and Miles Millar-scripted premiere catches us up on Wednesday&rsquo;s summer vacation, which involved refusing to edit her novel, mastering her psychic abilities and using them to track down a serial killer. Sure. Why not?<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-2\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article2-uid1\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-article2_0__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAutumn brings Wednesday back to Nevermore Academy, where she has become a school-wide celebrity after her killer-catching summer and all the various things that happened last season. Wednesday&rsquo;s roommate and bestie Enid (Emma Myers, the first season&rsquo;s other breakout) apparently spent her summer doing werewolf things and exploring new love (Noah B. Taylor as a character whose name might as well be Fresh Love Interest), but she&rsquo;s happy enough with her pal&rsquo;s notoriety.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nWednesday, unsurprisingly, is less pleased to be famous and even less pleased than that to be used as a school mascot by Barry Dort (Steve Buscemi), the just-arrived Dumblebore to this Slogwarts. She&rsquo;s more pleased that bodies are starting to pile up in the community of Jericho &mdash; odd things make Wednesday happy &mdash; all with their eyes plucked out by crows and most with some connection to Wednesday.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAdding to Wednesday&rsquo;s discomfort &mdash; which isn&rsquo;t nearly as funny this time around &mdash; is the injection of the entire Addams clan into the Nevermore scene. Pugsley (Isaac Ordonez), who shoots electricity from his fingertips, is now an enrolled student, for whatever reason. Meanwhile, Principal Dort has decided that the key to his crucial fundraising initiative is getting money from Morticia&rsquo;s (Catherine Zeta-Jones) apparently wealthy mother, and that the best way to do that is to put Morticia in charge of the fundraising committee, and the best way to do that is to put Morticia up at an on-campus cottage. Gomez (Luis Guzman) has nothing else to do, so he&rsquo;s there too.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-7\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid2\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_4__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nSo whereas my original review of the first season praised&nbsp;<em>Wednesday&nbsp;</em>for having the restraint and focus to not simply become&nbsp;<em>The Addams Family</em>&hellip;&nbsp;<em>Wednesday</em>&nbsp;has simply become&nbsp;<em>The Addams Family</em>, complete with a recast, still underutilized, Lurch (Joonas Suotamo) and the always handy Thing (Victor Dorobantu). Only Uncle Fester (Fred Armisen) hasn&rsquo;t become a full-time member of the ensemble, but he appears in the &ldquo;midseason&rdquo; &ldquo;finale&rdquo; (words have lost all meaning).<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThough a bunch of key characters from last season&rsquo;s murder mystery have been written out or written into guest appearances, there are lots of new additions, including Billie Piper as a music teacher; Thandiwe Newton as a doctor at a nearby asylum (with Heather Matarazzo as an administrator at the same asylum); Christopher Lloyd as a head-in-a-jar; and, in the non-stunt-casting department, wide-eyed Evie Templeton as Wednesday&rsquo;s No.1 fan.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nEven if Burton hadn&rsquo;t already made a movie celebrating his appreciation of big eyes, you&rsquo;d know that Templeton is the director&rsquo;s preferred brand of ingenue, and she stands out from the frantically overstuffed cast. Along those lines, it&rsquo;s a true puzzlement that Buscemi and Burton have only worked together on 2003&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Big Fish</em>, though this underwritten role isn&rsquo;t the best fodder for collaboration.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nI can&rsquo;t think of any more damning criticism for these four new episodes of&nbsp;<em>Wednesday</em>&nbsp;that, just two days after watching them, I legitimately can&rsquo;t remember anything that Wednesday is trying to accomplish this season, nor any single withering line of dialogue. Though the one-liners were rarely as sharp as they should have been in the first season, they were reliably low-level clever and the show got tremendous mileage out of putting Wednesday in one un-Wednesday situation after another, peaking with the dance scene, one of those extraordinarily rare instances of a moment that was instantly iconic.&nbsp;<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-11-1\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid3\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_5__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe second season doesn&rsquo;t attempt to immediately reproduce the dance scene, and thank heavens for that. But nothing so far has counted as the equivalent of that scene or an attempt to one-up that scene. With the possible exception of one stunt in the third episode, almost all of the &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be funny if Wednesday&hellip;&rdquo; brainstorming seems to have run dry. Wednesday has been reduced to a psychic gumshoe prone to seizures and crying blood (or unnamed black fluid) from the overuse of her powers. Ortega&rsquo;s deadpan remains impeccable and her mournful gaze allows for viewer projection that goes beyond anything on the page, but Wednesday too often comes across as a piece of an ensemble at this point.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAnd as for the over-Addams-ing of the second season, I&rsquo;m afraid that as much as I enjoyed Zeta-Jones and Guzman&rsquo;s horny interpretations of Morticia and Gomez in their original guest turns, giving them more screen time has not, in fact, made either performance more interesting. In fact, re-contextualizing all of the Addams relatives into an exceptional world, in which what once made them creepy, kooky and altogether ooky is commonplace, drains them of any distinction at all. The family isn&rsquo;t funny because they&rsquo;re horror-friendly oddities; they&rsquo;re funny because they&rsquo;re horror-friendly oddities plunked in a mundane world.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nContrast is funny. Season two of&nbsp;<em>Wednesday</em>&nbsp;has no contrast. It&rsquo;s acceptably gloomy &mdash; production and costume design on the show remain top-notch &mdash; and sporadically droll, and when you&rsquo;re seeing the world through Tim Burton&rsquo;s eyes (he directed two of these four episodes), there will always be off-kilter treasures like the animated urban legend in the premiere. But the thing that&rsquo;s most surprising about season two of&nbsp;<em>Wednesday&nbsp;</em>is how quickly&nbsp;<em>Wednesday</em> appears to have run out of surprises.&nbsp;<br>",

Fiennes / Show &hellip;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nNobody has yet been announced for the franchise&rsquo;s biggest villain, but an interesting question is: When will the main actor for the role first show up? In the films, Fiennes didn&rsquo;t appear until the forth movie,&nbsp;<em>Goblet of Fire</em>, as that&rsquo;s when Voldemort first takes human form. But his face appears at the end of the first film (played by Richard Bremmer), and in the second film, he appears as his younger self, Tom Riddle (played by Christian Peter Coulson). Given the production has cast several roles that didn&rsquo;t appear until the latter films, it wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprising if the production has quietly already cast an actor to play Voldemort throughout the entire series.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n</div>",

    "content": "John Oliver&nbsp;may delight in biting the corporate hand that feeds him &mdash; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no tastier hand,&rdquo; he insists &mdash; but he is deeply grateful for his perch. With his&nbsp;pal&nbsp;Stephen Colbert&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Late Show</em>&nbsp;recently canceled amid financial losses to the tune of tens of millions a year and a pending multibillion-dollar merger at its parent company, Oliver&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Last Week Tonight</em>&nbsp;finds itself ensconced in its premium cable/streaming corner at&nbsp;HBO, where it tackles complicated, often uncomfortable subjects such as immigration, policing and juvenile justice.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nStill, Oliver is adamant that it&rsquo;s the show&rsquo;s bevy of&nbsp;awards&nbsp;&mdash; 30&nbsp;Emmys&nbsp;and counting &mdash; that has kept it on the air and without interference for 12 seasons. Come September, it will vie for six more, including outstanding scripted variety series. Zooming from&nbsp;<em>Last</em><em> </em><em>Week Tonight</em>&rsquo;s Manhattan offices in late July, Oliver weighed in on his battles with legal, his concerns for late night and his desired level of anxiety.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<div class=\"injected-related-story // u-margin-tb-250 u-margin-t-4@desktop-xl u-margin-b-3@desktop-xl\">\r\n<strong><em>Last Week Tonight</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;segments come together in six weeks. When in that timeline does the comedy get layered in?</strong><br>\r\nReally late. The jokes used to come in earlier, but you don&rsquo;t want to start writing before a story is stable because then you&rsquo;ll fall in love with jokes that are built on material that doesn&rsquo;t stand up, and that&rsquo;s a terrible position to put comedy writers in. So, it&rsquo;s only in the last two weeks that the jokes come in. But in that first month, you&rsquo;re trying to give people ingredients that they&rsquo;ll be able to create comedy from. You want it to be like an episode of&nbsp;<em>Chopped</em>, where it&rsquo;s not impossible to make something palatable at the end. So, you&rsquo;re not giving them broken glass and weed killer. You&rsquo;ll give them eggs.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-2\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article2-uid1\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-article2_0__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>When was last time a&nbsp;<em>Last Week</em>&nbsp;segment made you genuinely anxious?</strong><br>\r\nI mean, there&rsquo;s always a low-level anxiety with every story. I&rsquo;d argue a healthy level of anxiety. And it&rsquo;s only ever about whether people are going to be willing to listen to us talk about something, because it&rsquo;s so superficially dry or contentious that you&rsquo;re not sure if it&rsquo;s something people will want to hear, and then you&rsquo;re practicing force-feeding. But that&rsquo;s part of the joy of having this show &mdash; the ability to show people things they might not necessarily think, on their face, they want to see. I mean, just a few weeks ago, we did a long piece on juvenile justice, and that&rsquo;s the kind of story where you think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure people want to hear this,&rdquo; but I am sure that it&rsquo;s the absolute point of having a show like this.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>From the&nbsp;Emmy stage, you thanked HBO and &ldquo;our lawyers, who are angry with us all the time.&rdquo; What is that push and pull like?</strong><br>\r\nThey are our final line of defense, so it has to be a functional relationship, but it can be fraught, especially toward the end. The general tension that we land on is having a slightly different view of their job. They think it&rsquo;s to stop us from getting sued, and I think it&rsquo;s to make sure that when we are sued, we win. So, yeah, I&rsquo;m half-joking when I say it&rsquo;s a fraught relationship. It&rsquo;s an important process for the script to go through, but it can be not infrequently tense.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>I can imagine.</strong><br>\r\nBut you also don&rsquo;t get to be angry at the lifesaving device. (<em>Laughs</em>.)<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-9\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid2\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_7__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>You&rsquo;ve had a revolving door of corporate owners. Is interference something you&rsquo;ve either experienced or worry about?</strong><br>\r\nWe&rsquo;ve not experienced interference, and I refuse to worry about something that hasn&rsquo;t happened yet. My tolerance level, were it to, would be zero. This would be over real quick.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>Put another way, is there a &ldquo;there but for the grace of God go I&rdquo; aspect to what appears to have happened with Colbert and his show?</strong><br>\r\nWe are fortunate enough to be in a very different situation than network commercial TV, so those corporate pressures are not comparable, and we have no pressures from advertisers.<br><br><br>\r\n<strong>Presumably you saw the shots of Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav palling around with Ivanka Trump in Sun Valley. What goes through your mind when you see something like that?</strong><br>\r\nI try to pay as little attention to what is happening outside of our show as possible because it feels like wasted energy. The moment that intrudes on our show, I will react very badly to it, but it hasn&rsquo;t. So, yeah, I try not to get angry about things that aren&rsquo;t happening to us.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>At the same time, you seem to bite the hand that feeds you with regularity and some degree of glee &hellip;</strong><br>\r\nThere&rsquo;s no tastier hand!<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>I was watching the segment that you did a few months ago about Trump and the media, and at one point, you just started railing against your corporate parent and the idiocy of the HBO Max name changes. Again, seemingly with glee. Did you hear from anyone afterward?</strong><br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-18-1\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid3\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_8__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\nNo. And you&rsquo;re right, I&rsquo;m truly happy in those moments. That&rsquo;s probably the most at peace I am, when I&rsquo;m trying to draw fire from our owners.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>Should we unpack that? What does that say about you?</strong><br>\r\nI don&rsquo;t know, and I refuse to turn this into a therapy session. (<em>Laughs</em>.) But I always used to love watching David Letterman do it. To me, it felt like a really healthy sign of contempt and just a very fun and slightly important indication of noncompliance. So, I loved it when he&rsquo;d make fun of G.E. and CBS and, yeah, for me, making fun of whoever owns us on a minute-to-minute basis is a thrill.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>You grew up on Letterman. Do you worry about the&nbsp;future of late night TV?</strong><br>\r\nOn network TV? Yeah, it&rsquo;s constantly evolving. What&rsquo;s happened to&nbsp;<em>The Late Show</em>&nbsp;is incredibly sad for comedy and, obviously, for the staff in that building. It really resonated with me when&nbsp;Stephen said he was hoping to hand this show over to someone else. You hope that the franchise lives on partly because there are generations of teenagers watching those shows and deciding, &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;d like to be a comedy writer,&rdquo; and then maybe writing on that show. So, just as there are Colbert writers that watched Letterman, there will be future writers that watched Colbert, and you want that to continue. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll find a way to exist in some form, we just don&rsquo;t yet know exactly what that&rsquo;s going to look like for network television.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>You&rsquo;ve had success having a point of view on your show, as Colbert has, at least in the ratings. Late night used to be broad, unifying entertainment. I know Jay Leno recently spoke on this topic, about making a show for everyone &hellip;</strong><br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-24-2\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid4\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_9__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\nI&rsquo;m going to take a hard pass on taking comedic advice from Jay Leno.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>Fair enough, but should these shows still try to be for everyone, or is that as antiquated as the tanning bed?</strong><br>\r\nWho thinks that way? Executives? Comedy can&rsquo;t be for everyone. It&rsquo;s inherently subjective. So, yeah, when you do stand-up, some people try to play to a broader audience, which is completely legitimate. Others decide not to, which is equally legitimate. I guess I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a question of what you should do because I don&rsquo;t think comedy is prescriptive in that way. It&rsquo;s just what people want. I think our show clearly comes from a point of view, but most of those long stories we do are not party political. They&rsquo;re about systemic issues. Our last few shows were about gang databases, AI slop, juvenile justice, med spas, air traffic control. I&rsquo;m not saying that these don&rsquo;t have a point of view in them. Of course they do. But I hope a lot of them actually reach across people&rsquo;s political persuasions. You want people to at least be able to agree on the problem, even if you disagree on what the solution to it is.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>As someone who&rsquo;s found a version of a late night show that succeeds on streaming, do you think it&rsquo;s replicable and, if so, what should it look like?</strong><br>\r\nI have absolutely no idea. [Late&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> media columnist] David Carr said something so nice at the end of our first year. He&rsquo;d liked our show, and he said to me, &ldquo;If you had described this show to me before I saw it, I would&rsquo;ve said it sounded terrible.&rdquo; It was so honest; I&rsquo;ve never forgotten it. Because I don&rsquo;t think, on the page, our show sounds very good. I mean, we&rsquo;re doing, like, 40 minutes on juvenile justice.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>It doesn&rsquo;t exactly scream commercial.</strong><br>\r\nNo, it doesn&rsquo;t. So I don&rsquo;t know that you can emulate this success. I think it might&rsquo;ve been a mistake or a lightning strike. I just don&rsquo;t know that this is scalable. But I&rsquo;d really like late night to exist in some form somewhere. My favorite thing is when you can have things that both have a strong point of view and are incredibly stupid. Seth [Meyers], last week, did some great shows, and he also did an amazing segment about how to pronounce &ldquo;croissant.&rdquo; Did you see that? It was so good. It was the hardest I laughed all week. So, I love the fact that those things can coexist, and I don&rsquo;t want that to go away.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>The camaraderie that the late night hosts have now is so vastly different from the environment you grew up with.</strong><br>\r\nWell, the stakes are just lower now. There&rsquo;s no point being in a war. You&rsquo;re not fighting over any meaningful territory. (<em>Laughs</em>.)<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>Many of you came on&nbsp;Colbert&rsquo;s show on July 21, appearing in a Coldplay kiss-cam spoof,&nbsp;shortly after the news of his cancellation. What did that outreach look like?</strong><br>\r\nWell, we&rsquo;ve been in contact as a group since the strike [several of them hosted a podcast,&nbsp;<em>Strike Force Five</em>], so as soon as the news broke, we were all checking in with Stephen in that chat and then he came up with the idea and asked us to come, and of course we&rsquo;re all going to do it. You want to be able to support him and his staff in a horrible, horrible time.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>I did appreciate just how much everyone sort of played into their brand while sitting there, down to Anderson Cooper looking fairly uncomfortable.</strong><br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-36-4\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid6\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_11__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\nAnderson was almost emitting a sense of, &ldquo;Why am I here?&rdquo; A legitimate question!<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>Back to your show. Amid all the bleakness, you and your writers decided to give yourselves this ambitious side project, rebranding a minor league baseball team the&nbsp;Erie Moon Mammoths. How much pressure did you feel to make sure that was something that could produce actual civic pride, rather than simply five funny minutes on HBO?</strong><br>\r\nThe reason we first started talking about it is that we were doing a show about deportations &mdash; so, monumentally bleak &mdash; and it felt like an example of when you&rsquo;ve had a kale-based meal, it&rsquo;s nice to serve something resembling a dessert at the end of it. One of our writers, Charlie, he pitched this story about minor league baseball and just how eccentric and, in many ways, life affirming it is, and we had the idea at the end of that to issue this offer [to have&nbsp;<em>Last Week Tonight</em>&nbsp;have carte blanche to rebrand a team]. We thought someone might take our offer, but we weren&rsquo;t sure. So, if it was just that and no one offered, that was fine. Once it became clear that people were really interested, then it felt like it might be something that could spin us out of a bunch of very dense, dark stories. Then you want to execute it as well as you possibly can. You don&rsquo;t want it to be a drive-by joke at the place you&rsquo;re picking. You want to pick a place that can handle it but also needs it.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>It became a feel-good story at a time when we so desperately need a feel-good story.</strong><br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-40-5\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid7\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_12__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\nI know. It is odd the extent to which it repaired some of my faith in human nature, and that is a very weird thing to find yourself saying when you&rsquo;re standing next to a seven-foot purple mammoth.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>Speaking of happy endings, earlier this year,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>HBO let you return to releasing full segments of your show on YouTube the day after airing. What changed?</strong><br>\r\nI think they wanted to see if moving it back on YouTube had an effect on our ratings. I didn&rsquo;t think it would, which is why I was against moving it in the first place. And I was massively grateful that, upon looking at it, they realized it wasn&rsquo;t having a negative enough effect to be worth doing. Again, in the difficulty of the media environment that we&rsquo;re in, I try to be as cognizant as I can be that HBO is still a fantastic place to work.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>And yet you make a lot of jokes about how all these Emmys are your show&rsquo;s only armor against getting canceled.</strong><br>\r\nI mean, two things can be true at the same time. (<em>Laughs</em>.) It&rsquo;s a fantastic place to work while we are insulated by golden armor. If that stops, we might be going away.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<strong>Do you genuinely believe that?</strong><br>\r\nIt&rsquo;s not entirely a joke, that&rsquo;s for sure. I think it is objectively very, very helpful to have won Emmys with the show. I think it has helped us keep our independence and keep the show on the air. So, yeah, I do think there is a utility to it. It&rsquo;s something that I know has always been important to HBO, and so I&rsquo;m massively grateful that we&rsquo;ve won them, and long may that continue. Please! I don&rsquo;t want my theory tested.<br>\r\n</div>",

    "summary": "THR is also debuting new stills from Richard Linklater's homage to 'Breathless' and the French New Wave, which premiered in May at the Cannes Film Festival, where it received rave reviews.",
    "content": "<em>Nouvelle Vague</em>,&nbsp;<strong>Richard Linklater</strong>&rsquo;s loving homage to&nbsp;<strong>Jean Luc-Godard</strong>&rsquo;s 1960 film&nbsp;<em>Breathless</em>&nbsp;and the French New Wave, which received&nbsp;a 10-minute standing ovation&nbsp;and rave reviews following its world premiere at May&rsquo;s Cannes Film Festival, will be released in American theaters on Oct. 31 and play on big screens for two weeks before dropping on&nbsp;Netflix&nbsp;on Nov. 14,&nbsp;<em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>&nbsp;has learned.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nWhen Netflix&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;<em>Nouvelle Vague</em>&rsquo;s U.S. rights shortly after Cannes, some reacted with surprise and dismay that a movie shot on film and about cinema would end up with a streamer. But the company is planning a robust theatrical release that will include not only screens in New York (where, appropriately enough, it owns the historic Paris Theater) and LA, but in all of the top 10 U.S. markets.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAdditionally,&nbsp;<em>THR</em>&nbsp;can report that the largely French-language film will be pushed across all categories. In my humble opinion, it could well end up a finalist for best picture, a category in which non-English-language films have landed many noms in recent years (including France&rsquo;s Netflix-distributed&nbsp;<em>Emilia P&eacute;rez</em>&nbsp;earlier this year); best director (Linklater is a beloved&nbsp;<em>auteur</em>, but his only nom in the category came for 2014&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Boyhood</em>); and screenplay (it has yet to be determined if&nbsp;<strong>Holly Gent</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Laetitia Masson</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Vincent Palmo Jr.</strong>&rsquo;s script will be classified as adapted or original).<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nMeanwhile,&nbsp;<strong>Zoey Deutch</strong>, who is luminous as&nbsp;<em>Breathless</em>&nbsp;star&nbsp;<strong>Jean Seberg</strong>, will be campaigned in the supporting actress race, while French actors&nbsp;<strong>Guillaume Marbeck</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Aubry Dullin</strong>, who eerily resemble the characters they play &mdash;&nbsp;Godard and&nbsp;<em>Breathless</em>&nbsp;breakout&nbsp;<strong>Jean-Paul Belmondo</strong> &mdash;&nbsp;will be pushed for lead actor and supporting actor, respectively.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<div class=\"a-content a-content--left-space lrv-a-floated-parent lrv-u-font-family-body lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-font-size-20  u-font-size-22@tablet a-icon-endbug lrv-u-position-relative\">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-paywall\">\r\n<div class=\"post-content-image //  \">\r\n<figure class=\"o-figure   size-large alignnone lrv-u-max-width-100p\">\r\n<div class=\"c-lazy-image  \">\r\n<div class=\"lrv-a-crop-16x9\"><img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NOUVELLE_VAGUE_n_00_23_18_04-H-2025.jpg?w=1296\" alt=\"\" width=\"1296\" height=\"730\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption class=\"c-figcaption  lrv-u-padding-tb-025\">Zoey Deutch as Jean Seberg in&nbsp;<em>Nouvelle Vague</em>&nbsp;<cite class=\"a-font-accent-uppercase-xs lrv-u-color-grey-dark\">Courtesy of Netflix<br><br></cite></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\nThe big question moving forward is whether or not France will select&nbsp;<em>Nouvelle Vague</em>&nbsp;as its entry for the best international feature Oscar competition. Each country&rsquo;s submission is determined by a selection committee comprised mostly of people associated with that country&rsquo;s film industry, who must attest that &ldquo;creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe key word is &ldquo;largely.&rdquo; In the case of&nbsp;<em>Nouvelle Vague</em>, Linklater and Deutch are American, but almost everyone else who worked in front of or behind the camera is French, including the film&rsquo;s two producers,&nbsp;<strong>Laurent P&eacute;tin</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Mich&egrave;le P&eacute;tin</strong>, so the film is certainly eligible. Plus, its financing came from France; it was shot in France; it premiered in France; and it is an out-and-out celebration of French cinema.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nSome selection committees are hesitant to submit a film directed by someone born outside of their country&rsquo;s borders, feeling that doing so would be a missed opportunity to highlight homegrown talent. But other countries enter whichever film they think offers them the best shot at actually landing an Oscar nom. For instance, Japan put forward &mdash; and landed a nom in 2024 for &mdash; German filmmaker&nbsp;<strong>Wim Wenders</strong>&rsquo;&nbsp;<em>Perfect Days</em>. Polish filmmaker&nbsp;<strong>Agnieszka Holland</strong>&nbsp;has had films entered by Poland, West Germany and the Czech Republic. And twice in the last decade, France itself submitted films by non-French filmmakers: Dutch filmmaker&nbsp;<strong>Paul Verhoeven</strong>&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Elle</em>&nbsp;in 2016 and Italian filmmaker&nbsp;<strong>Filippo Neneghetti</strong>&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Two of Us</em>&nbsp;in 2020.<br>\r\n<div id=\"adm-inline-article-ad-x-6\" class=\"admz \">\r\n<div class=\"adma boomerang \">\r\n<div class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\">\r\n<div id=\"gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid2\" class=\" adw-300 adh-250\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/THR/ros/mid-articleX_2__container__\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nFrance, however, has had bruising experiences with its last two submissions. In 2024, it&nbsp;entered&nbsp;<em>The Taste of Things</em>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<em>Anatomy of a Fall</em>; ultimately, the former was not nominated, while the latter went on to five other noms (best picture, director, original screenplay, actress and film editing), suggesting that it almost certainly would have been nominated for &mdash; and might have even won &mdash; best international feature had it been entered. And in 2025, its submission&nbsp;<em>Emilia P&eacute;rez</em>&nbsp;looked certain to bring the country its first win in the category since&nbsp;<em>Indochine</em>&nbsp;prevailed in 1993,&nbsp;but its prospects imploded shortly before the final round of voting, thanks to the exposure of problematic social media posts from its principal star, and it ultimately lost.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nAgain,&nbsp;<em>Emilia P&eacute;rez</em>&nbsp;was handled by Netflix, so you can be sure that the company is hungry for another chance to get a French film across the finish line in the best international feature Oscar race. (In just the last six years, it backed two films from other countries that went on to win that prize, Mexico&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Roma</em>&nbsp;in 2019 and Germany&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em>&nbsp;in 2023.) But the decision about whether or not it will have that opportunity is ultimately France&rsquo;s, or at least the French selection committee&rsquo;s.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nGiven that no other French film has emerged this year, so far, that would appear to offer the nation a&nbsp;<em>better</em>&nbsp;shot than&nbsp;<em>Nouvelle Vague</em>&nbsp;at landing a best international feature Oscar nom, and possibly even a win, it will be very interesting to see how France&rsquo;s selection committee plays it cards.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<div class=\"post-content-image //  \">\r\n<figure class=\"o-figure   size-large alignnone lrv-u-max-width-100p\">\r\n<div class=\"c-lazy-image  \">\r\n<div class=\"lrv-a-crop-16x9\"><img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NOUVELLE_VAGUE_n_00_14_38_01-H-2025.jpg?w=1296\" alt=\"\" width=\"1296\" height=\"730\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption class=\"c-figcaption  lrv-u-padding-tb-025\">Guillaume Marbeck as Jean Luc Godard in&nbsp;<em>Nouvelle Vague</em>&nbsp;<cite class=\"a-font-accent-uppercase-xs lrv-u-color-grey-dark\">Courtesy of Netflix</cite></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"piano-paywall\"></div>\r\n</div>",
